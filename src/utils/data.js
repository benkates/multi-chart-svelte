const fullText = `<div class="content" style="height: auto !important; min-height: 0px !important;"><strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey, so this isn't matching up with this...and I'm not sure which one's right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yes. Me do.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Me do it now. Go. Stop worry.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Kevin, do you feel OK?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Me feel good. Body strong. Sleep big last night.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah, alright Kev why don't you come with us?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: No, guys.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: No, he's fine.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: He's fine.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: He's always been like that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No he hasn't.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I mean, he's gotten worse over the years....<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: He's making a statement. It's an ironic comment on our expectations of him. A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: You keep think that.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say "car no go", and we best friends. So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Kevin, I appreciate what you're trying to do.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Thank.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code. And what we're talking about is...basically the speech equivalent... to just wearing underpants. Sometimes words, you no need use...but need need for talk talk.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: But save time. More success.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Does it save time though? ‘Cause we've been here for about an hour.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: No me fault.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Kevin, at most you're saving a microscopic amount of time.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Many small time make big time.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: What are you gonna do with all this time?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: See world.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: K, Kevin, are you saying "See the world"? or "Sea World?"<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: See world. Oceans. Fish. Jump. China.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, see? Right there, that's the problem with your method. ‘Cause I still don't know if you're saying "Sea World" or "see the world," and it's taking a lot of time to explain it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Fine, fine. I'll talk normally.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling] They see.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet....the Pyramid. [holds up triangle shaped touch pad]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Ooh, why is it shaped like that?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: So, you can tell your clients: "Unleash the power of the pyramid."<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: It's huge. How much does it weigh?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh no no no. Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it's barely three pounds.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: How much memory does it have without the booster?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Fifty L.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: I'm sorry," L"?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: How many L to a K?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You're really going to want the booster.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: How on earth are we supposed to sell...?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I'll take five.<br>
<br>
[Andy walks in with ties on his arm]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Andy, don't make us sell this stupid thing.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight's meeting.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Thank you.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties...and tie clips. Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? [To Oscar] What do you think, C-SPAN?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: ..."C-SPAN"?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yeah. C-SPAN, cocker spaniel. Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause......<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Is this really the best use of our collective time?
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I am still forming a first impression with Robert. Once it is formed, we can all relax. Ok, I'm sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog...had to pull rank.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [to group] OK, let's look at some ties.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Here's how I'm going to help out from now on. I'm going to not care, and I'm going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy's inevitable demise.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [To Oscar] Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Um, D-Dog, you have a message.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Erin, you don't need to call him that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Andy wants us to, P-Dog.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: It's ok E-Dog, just who called?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Justine. She said she's coming by later.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Your ex-wife?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?<br>
<br>
[Group murmurs, offended]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: No no no no. I like her.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Well I'm just quoting you. I would never say that about her. I don't know the woman.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Nah man, we get along now. Real well.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wow. Alright. Can't wait to meet her.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: I'll introduce you.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose. But last night we put a lot of that to bed. I can't tell you what I did with my ex wife last night.... I have to sing it. [singing] We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [to Robert California] Hi Dad!...... Ahhh....oh boy.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Hello, Andy. Excellent tie.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you're here?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: I'd love some coffee.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: I was looking over your projections, and I think we can do better.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Are you factoring in the... whole national ...economy.... declining and all that?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Andy, do you know why I chose you?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor....vanilla?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Vanilla? No no no no. You'll never guess in a million billion years you'll never guess.
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You were saying you chose me.... There was a reason?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Andy, can you inspire? Do you have that skill set?<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Can I inspire? [laughs] I don't know!.....I don't know.<br>

<hr>

[Erin enters with overflowing cup of coffee]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Oh! Thank you. Uh....<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Oh, sorry.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: You can just put it down.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Oh<br>
<br>
[Erin sets cup down and Robert sips it]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: That is very cold.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Yeah. It's old. [smiling]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Why would I.....?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said "coffee"....<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Why don't we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Andy, you don't want that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I've been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. [sips] Mmm....<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Sorry.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: You like her.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I do.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: She likes you.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You know, we've both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up. Now we're in this weird dance....<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: [interrupting] I'm afraid you've lost my interest.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Let me call you back.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: I gotta go.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here?<br>
<br>
[Kevin Raises hand]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Ah...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: This is where we go<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: [chuckling] Oh, you'd go someplace else. That's not it, that's not the answer.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: It's a answer.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: It's a wrong answer.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: There are no wrong answers.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at it's birth. Those superstores are terrified of us. Anybody know why?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Wait....they're terrified?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Let me tell you how I buy something these days. I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price. Or I don't know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me. The era of personal service is back. You are back. You'll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them "you are welcome." [Applause] Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people. Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen. Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You got it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Double.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Done.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: I'm not kidding.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Neither am I, it's already done. Hah, I'm just kidding, it's going to take some time.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Double.<br>

<hr>

[Andy knocks on Jim's desk]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey. [Andy pushes things aside and sits on top of Jim's desk, kicking things in the process.]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: What's up, guys? Just thought we'd have a little rap session, talk about business...see how things are going? Ahem...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Why don't you start?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert...man. What a boss. Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how's the sales doubling ...project going?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can't just press a magic button.
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: OF course not. There's no magic button. You have to summon that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: If we could just double our sales, we already would have. You're not making any sense.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: He brings up two good points. Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Dwight, anything?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they're out of the house.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Fart..... good Sesh. [gets up] That leg's asleep.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Justine</strong>: Hello. I'm looking for Darryl Philbin?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Don't! oh, you must think...I'm not. I'm using the fax, this isn't, no wait. I'm not supposed to represent the company. Right? There's usually an Erin here.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Justine</strong>: Ok....?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: So...DARRYL! A GIRL!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: [Singing] rub a dub dub...I got scrubbed. ‘Sup, darlin'? Everybody, this is Justine. [murmurs of hello from the group] This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Hi.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Kevin.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Justine</strong>: Can we.... go some place private?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Follow me, I got a space. After you. I've been thinking about you all mornin'. I don't know what you did, I can barely walk today.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: D-Bone. There you are.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie...? Lick the spoon?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No, that's ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about...
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don't see the point. It's so Wall Street.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I know, right?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Right?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yeah...um, how is everything?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Good. Really really good.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Must be a tough time to be a family farm.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh, it is. And beets are not immune. We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Oof. What are you gonna do about that?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I don't know, what do you mean?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: There's gotta be some way you can double your beet sales...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You wanted the job, the job is yours. Just do the job! [Licks brownie battered finger] And I'll do mine..... walnuts?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: No!<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici's favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: She looks at it when she's on the potty, and she makes the faces.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I flipped through it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you're pregnant?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Of course.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: We know that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk. Would you like to join me?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: That sounds nice.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Great.[Angela walks away]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You have a walking buddy.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I do.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Thanks for coming in guys.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: You don't have to thank us for coming in, it's our job.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I'm gonna thank people.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: What's with the blanket?<br>
<br>
[Andy removes blanket over table to reveal various items]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: This is what's under the blanket.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: We don't get it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: These are incentives. It's how we're gonna double growth. Now, you're probably all asking yourselves: "Well, how does this work?"<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You're exactly right and you get a point.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh. [smiling]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Uh, is that a vibrator?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Twenty points.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: How does one get a point?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I've outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It's so gross.
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: There's lots of stuff. John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: How ‘bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I can't.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: This point system is really insulting.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Ooh I didn't mean to offend you, and I hope you'll forgive me because I am very very... Sari. [tosses yellow print material over shoulder] Sixteen points.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: That's a tablecloth.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: That's a crazy amount of points.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: But, what if?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Well, what do you want?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I don't know, for such a crazy number I'd like something pretty crazy.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work. [laughter]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: That's pretty good. What about uh, for a thousand points?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I'll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong. [laughter] Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard![Andy points to his rear-end]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Group</strong>: Ooooh!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Really?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Swear to God, hope to die. Now let's get to work!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case...let's get to work.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yeah!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah! Whoo! [Group cheers]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [on the phone]I can have it to you by the beginning of next week. Alright? Thanks very much. [hangs up] Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>:[hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen's bananas.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Ok.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: T-bag bone...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Andrew.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, I didn't notice anything.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years....and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down. Now look at him.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: [On the phone] You've got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I don't know what to tell you, man.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You think it has something to do with that incentive program?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, one hundred percent. We all want to see you tattoo your ass.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Bah...I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Nah, you definitely weren't kidding. And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Hundred and twenty points.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah. Big sale. Don't worry about it though, I don't really care about the points. I would like a point receipt though...[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald...can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman's?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [on the phone]and I'm back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Where's Angela? [Hands paper over her shoulder]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Hey Kevin, what are you doing?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Don't talk to me! [Everyone continues to work busily]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [on phone] Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of '95. Hey there, um, I'm a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question. I may be missing a chapter here...De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale...uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I'm in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations. [laughs]<br>

<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Took ‘em one day.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Ready! [flips sketch pad showing tattoo possibilities] "I'm not as think as you drunk I am!" [crowd claps and cheers]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: I like it, I like it! [Pam flips the page]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Do Not Resuscitate...[mild cheering]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: OK, keep in mind, it's not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions. My car [nervous laughter] for a thousand points....or best offer.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: What else you got?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, and then this was Phyllis's idea...[shocked cheers] So nasty Phyllis!<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: We were hoping you could do something like this...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Tattoo Artist</strong>: So, coming out of his butt is a...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Baby.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Tattoo Artist</strong>: Baby...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yes.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Tattoo Artist</strong>: Yeah, no problem.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: We should think about this...does anyone have any better ideas?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: I like what we have.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Looks good.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: For sure.<br>
<br>
[murmurs from group in agreement]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Just need a second outside.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Gettin' psyched up?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? ....Confession: I don't know what I'm doing.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I mean, do you like it? You having fun? [Andy snorts, unsure how to answer] Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun....and you did that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: My ass is only so big, I mean I can't do this everyday.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: But I think it's big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea....which, by the way, I can't wait for.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No one expects me to go through with this, right?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Absolutely not.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Let's ink...my stink! [crowd cheers]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people.<br>

[Andy removes his pants]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Group</strong>: Whoa!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [lying on table] Do your worst!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Tattoo Artist</strong>: Uh, you can keep your pants on actually...if just drop ‘em down a bit, that'd be great.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: They are already off, my good sir.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Tattoo Artist</strong>: I'd really prefer they not be down.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Well, I think down's better. Sweating pretty heavily down there.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Do you think you could work from this? [showing Tattoo artist sketch pad] we made some small adjustments.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Tattoo Artist</strong>: OK, you want me to...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Just a few adjustments<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Tattoo Artist</strong>: Alright, let's begin.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: This is where I grin and be-YOW OW!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Tattoo Artist</strong>: That was just the cotton swab.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Invest in softer cotton, sir. [tattooing begins] OW! Oh! Oooh! [Crowd cheers] oh, whoa!!<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I'm gonna like it.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: DRAW SOME BLOOD!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: AHHHHH!!!!!!!<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he's all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [removes tape to reveal tattoo of puppy] It's a Nard Dog! [group cheers] That's my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Pull up your pants.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: There's something about an underdog that really inspires...the unexceptional.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Um, what should we talk about?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I'm having.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don't know if I should call social services about it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Angela, that's pretty transparently me.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Maybe.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You know it's just herbal tea.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: In mugs with trace amounts of coffee!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah. I think you should call social services.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I already did.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we're in this together.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Fine.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Fine.</div>`;
