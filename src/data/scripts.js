      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yes. Me do.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Me do it now. Go. Stop worry.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Kevin, do you feel OK?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Me feel good. Body strong. Sleep big last night.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah, alright Kev why don't you come with us?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: No, guys.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: No, he's fine.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: He's fine.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: He's always been like that.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No he hasn't.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I mean, he's gotten worse over the years....<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: He's making a statement. It's an ironic comment on our expectations of him. A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: You keep think that.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say "car no go", and we best friends. So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Kevin, I appreciate what you're trying to do.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Thank.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code. And what we're talking about is...basically the speech equivalent... to just wearing underpants. Sometimes words, you no need use...but need need for talk talk.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: But save time. More success.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Does it save time though? ‘Cause we've been here for about an hour.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: No me fault.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Kevin, at most you're saving a microscopic amount of time.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Many small time make big time.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: What are you gonna do with all this time?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: See world.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: K, Kevin, are you saying "See the world"? or "Sea World?"<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: See world. Oceans. Fish. Jump. China.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, see? Right there, that's the problem with your method. ‘Cause I still don't know if you're saying "Sea World" or "see the world," and it's taking a lot of time to explain it.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Fine, fine. I'll talk normally.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling] They see.<br>

      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet....the Pyramid. [holds up triangle shaped touch pad]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Ooh, why is it shaped like that?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: So, you can tell your clients: "Unleash the power of the pyramid."<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: It's huge. How much does it weigh?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh no no no. Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it's barely three pounds.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: How much memory does it have without the booster?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Fifty L.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: I'm sorry," L"?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: How many L to a K?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You're really going to want the booster.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: How on earth are we supposed to sell...?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I'll take five.<br>
      <br>
      [Andy walks in with ties on his arm]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Andy, don't make us sell this stupid thing.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight's meeting.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Thank you.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties...and tie clips. Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? [To Oscar] What do you think, C-SPAN?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: ..."C-SPAN"?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yeah. C-SPAN, cocker spaniel. Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause......<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Is this really the best use of our collective time?
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I am still forming a first impression with Robert. Once it is formed, we can all relax. Ok, I'm sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog...had to pull rank.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [to group] OK, let's look at some ties.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Here's how I'm going to help out from now on. I'm going to not care, and I'm going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy's inevitable demise.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [To Oscar] Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Um, D-Dog, you have a message.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Erin, you don't need to call him that.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Andy wants us to, P-Dog.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: It's ok E-Dog, just who called?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Justine. She said she's coming by later.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Your ex-wife?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?<br>
      <br>
      [Group murmurs, offended]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: No no no no. I like her.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Well I'm just quoting you. I would never say that about her. I don't know the woman.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Nah man, we get along now. Real well.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wow. Alright. Can't wait to meet her.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: I'll introduce you.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose. But last night we put a lot of that to bed. I can't tell you what I did with my ex wife last night.... I have to sing it. [singing] We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.<br>

      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [to Robert California] Hi Dad!...... Ahhh....oh boy.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Hello, Andy. Excellent tie.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you're here?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: I'd love some coffee.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: I was looking over your projections, and I think we can do better.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Are you factoring in the... whole national ...economy.... declining and all that?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Andy, do you know why I chose you?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor....vanilla?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Vanilla? No no no no. You'll never guess in a million billion years you'll never guess.
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You were saying you chose me.... There was a reason?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Andy, can you inspire? Do you have that skill set?<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Can I inspire? [laughs] I don't know!.....I don't know.<br>

      [Erin enters with overflowing cup of coffee]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Oh! Thank you. Uh....<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Oh, sorry.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: You can just put it down.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Oh<br>
      <br>
      [Erin sets cup down and Robert sips it]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: That is very cold.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Yeah. It's old. [smiling]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Why would I.....?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said "coffee"....<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Why don't we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Andy, you don't want that.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I've been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. [sips] Mmm....<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Sorry.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: You like her.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I do.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: She likes you.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You know, we've both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up. Now we're in this weird dance....<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: [interrupting] I'm afraid you've lost my interest.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Let me call you back.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: I gotta go.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here?<br>
      <br>
      [Kevin Raises hand]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Ah...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: This is where we go<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: [chuckling] Oh, you'd go someplace else. That's not it, that's not the answer.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: It's a answer.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: It's a wrong answer.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: There are no wrong answers.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at it's birth. Those superstores are terrified of us. Anybody know why?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Wait....they're terrified?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Let me tell you how I buy something these days. I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price. Or I don't know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me. The era of personal service is back. You are back. You'll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them "you are welcome." [Applause] Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people. Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen. Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You got it.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Double.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Done.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: I'm not kidding.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Neither am I, it's already done. Hah, I'm just kidding, it's going to take some time.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Double.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      [Andy knocks on Jim's desk]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey. [Andy pushes things aside and sits on top of Jim's desk, kicking things in the process.]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: What's up, guys? Just thought we'd have a little rap session, talk about business...see how things are going? Ahem...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Why don't you start?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert...man. What a boss. Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how's the sales doubling ...project going?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can't just press a magic button.
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: OF course not. There's no magic button. You have to summon that.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: If we could just double our sales, we already would have. You're not making any sense.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: He brings up two good points. Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Dwight, anything?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they're out of the house.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Fart..... good Sesh. [gets up] That leg's asleep.<br>

      <strong class="text-strong">Justine</strong>: Hello. I'm looking for Darryl Philbin?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Don't! oh, you must think...I'm not. I'm using the fax, this isn't, no wait. I'm not supposed to represent the company. Right? There's usually an Erin here.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Justine</strong>: Ok....?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: So...DARRYL! A GIRL!<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: [Singing] rub a dub dub...I got scrubbed. ‘Sup, darlin'? Everybody, this is Justine. [murmurs of hello from the group] This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Hi.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Kevin.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Justine</strong>: Can we.... go some place private?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Follow me, I got a space. After you. I've been thinking about you all mornin'. I don't know what you did, I can barely walk today.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: D-Bone. There you are.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie...? Lick the spoon?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No, that's ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about...
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don't see the point. It's so Wall Street.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I know, right?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Right?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yeah...um, how is everything?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Good. Really really good.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Must be a tough time to be a family farm.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh, it is. And beets are not immune. We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Oof. What are you gonna do about that?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I don't know, what do you mean?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: There's gotta be some way you can double your beet sales...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You wanted the job, the job is yours. Just do the job! [Licks brownie battered finger] And I'll do mine..... walnuts?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: No!<br>

      <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici's favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: She looks at it when she's on the potty, and she makes the faces.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I flipped through it.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you're pregnant?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Of course.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: We know that.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk. Would you like to join me?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: That sounds nice.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Great.[Angela walks away]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You have a walking buddy.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I do.<br>

      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Thanks for coming in guys.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: You don't have to thank us for coming in, it's our job.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I'm gonna thank people.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: What's with the blanket?<br>
      <br>
      [Andy removes blanket over table to reveal various items]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: This is what's under the blanket.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: We don't get it.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: These are incentives. It's how we're gonna double growth. Now, you're probably all asking yourselves: "Well, how does this work?"<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You're exactly right and you get a point.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh. [smiling]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Uh, is that a vibrator?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Twenty points.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: How does one get a point?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I've outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It's so gross.
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: There's lots of stuff. John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: How ‘bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I can't.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: This point system is really insulting.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Ooh I didn't mean to offend you, and I hope you'll forgive me because I am very very... Sari. [tosses yellow print material over shoulder] Sixteen points.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: That's a tablecloth.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: That's a crazy amount of points.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: But, what if?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Well, what do you want?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I don't know, for such a crazy number I'd like something pretty crazy.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work. [laughter]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: That's pretty good. What about uh, for a thousand points?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I'll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong. [laughter] Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard![Andy points to his rear-end]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Group</strong>: Ooooh!<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Swear to God, hope to die. Now let's get to work!<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case...let's get to work.<br>
      <br>

      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, I didn't notice anything.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years....and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down. Now look at him.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: [On the phone] You've got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!<br>

      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I don't know what to tell you, man.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You think it has something to do with that incentive program?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, one hundred percent. We all want to see you tattoo your ass.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Bah...I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Nah, you definitely weren't kidding. And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Hundred and twenty points.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah. Big sale. Don't worry about it though, I don't really care about the points. I would like a point receipt though...[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald...can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt]<br>

      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: They are already off, my good sir.<br>

      <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he's all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him.<br>

      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.<br>

      <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I already did.<br>

      <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: At least.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I know what you'd do with all that money. [imitating Jim] "Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug."
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: SoHo's mostly lofts but OK.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Oh, god.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: And then my handsome husband...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Which ideally would be me....<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Would bring me a flavored coffee.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: [under her breath] get a divorce...get a divorce...<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone. [lowers voice] To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day. [normal voice] Darryl, how we doin' on the new warehouse guys?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: I don't know.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: No.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Are they on their way over?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: I haven't hired anyone.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: This is kinda time sensitive.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: I got it. I'm doin' it.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in? [Erin raises hand]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: As long as you guys don't need me up here.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: No..we don't<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I think we'll be fine. [group murmurs in agreement]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Are you volunteering?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Of course. I would. But my hip....I would k*ll to be at a hundred percent. [Angela rolls eyes]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Jim! How 'bout you?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god. [grunts] False. Andy, I will volunteer.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Great. And Kevin.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, thank you.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Sure.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Wait, wait. What's this? [holds up clipboard]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool.
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: It says "Lotto Pool", right on top. [points to obvious title]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Yeah. And I said sorry.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh come on. You really think I'm gonna have a fourteen pound baby?<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: When did I get so fat?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You look awesome.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Where are we in the process?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You do have a fantastic basement.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Right. Um, well how 'bout we take a look at some applications? ...This guy wrote his in green ink, that's pretty cool. Check it out. [attempts to give Darryl application who ignores him at first but then takes it]Hey! There ya go...there he is.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! [climbs into forklift]
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yup.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl.[no one laughs] What? No Newhart fans? OK...Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Female Applicant</strong>: Your old crew won the lottery?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Male Applicant 1</strong>: Wait, wait. So all the old guys quit?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Oh yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Well-<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian h*m*. [Andy laughs awkwardly]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you're all doing great. [group begins leaving] maybe grab a coffee..or if there's any donuts out you can split one. You know they're for everybody so people get fussy....You know what? Just have a donut. [shuts door and sits, gesturing for Darryl to sit next to him. Then gets up to stand near Darryl.] Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: I don't<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: OK.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: We need you, OK?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>:OK.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: OK?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Alright.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [Grunts while lifting box into truck] What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. [Erin grunts loudly and tosses box toward truck but misses]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I didn't feel anything.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we're gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Why do you wanna work here?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Male Applicant 1</strong>: I need a job.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: That's not a good reason.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Good. Keepin' 'em honest.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you're still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Are we scaring them straight....?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Nice. Right back where I like you. [Pam is sitting at reception covering for Erin] Can you make ten copies of this for me?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Why not? What are you doing?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Uh, buying lottery tickets online. [Ryan laughs]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You came in at 10:30 today, right?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: OK, (we'll just dismiss it.)??????<br>
      
      
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Is everyone licensed?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Male Applicant 2</strong>: Like a driver's license?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Female Applicant</strong>: Is this a joke?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: [On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I'd go with that.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Like baboons or elephants.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Not that, don't...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Kevin! Doesn't apply.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Right. My mom-<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: [grabbing Kevin's arm] You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it! [Kevin tears up]<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap? [raises hand and laughs] You'll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Male Applicant 1</strong>: How much longer is this gonna take?<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Did you hire 'em?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No. Because they all left.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: What do you mean "they left"?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn't help.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Then I think you should fire me.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: .....OK, this is weird. I don't, I don't get the joke.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: So Darryl says to me "fire me". But what he really means is "I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means." So I say "No, you're not fired." But what I really mean is "I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better."........I really hope that's what he and I mean.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Bulk or definition?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Definition.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Oh, he's plenty strong.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings....<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Our fake winnings<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: A...hot chocolate tea<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America's diminishing blue-collar workforce?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Gideon</strong>: North America...and, diminishing is a little reductive, but uh sure. That's the headline version.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Great....Well, it'll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Gideon</strong>: FYI, Wednesday through Friday I have a pretty full teaching schedule.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Eh, cool. We'll figure that out.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Nate</strong>: Also, FYI, ah, I don't techinically have a hearing problem, but sometimes when there's a lot of noises occurring uh at the same time, I'll hear 'em as one big jumble. Uh, again it's not that I can't hear, uh because that's false. I can. Um, I just can't distinguish between everything I'm hearing.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Got it. Dually noted. You! [points to Bruce] Coolest t*nk top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Bruce</strong>: Made it.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.<br>

      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Message in a Bottle, The Postman...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Kevin Costner.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Kevin Costner.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah. [sh*t shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: So, it's not the dumbest idea.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It's not the greatest one either...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: And it's clear we're not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in sh*t showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Exactly.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I think we're ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Is he OK?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yep. He'll be fine.<br>

      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Surprise! Your new crew.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Would you just fire me, man?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: You wanna make me happy? Huh?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Give me your job.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Haha, what?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Nate</strong>: Also, Darryl, FYI, I already told this to Andy, but uh, you should probably know I technically don't have a hearing problem, it's just when there's a lot of noises...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: He died.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: He didn't die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Nate</strong>: What wa-, what was the last...I'm havin' a-<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: None, no part of this has anything to do with you.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: I didn't have time because of my daughter.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a sh*t and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. [long pause]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: OK.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: OK what?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: OK, don't fire me.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Ah, OK.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yeah. [laughs] That makes sense. OK. Good, alright.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Here...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: What is goin' on?! [sh*t shows greased aisle flanked by rows of boxes]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Oh hey guys.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Why is the forklift in the wall?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Why is the truck empty?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Uh, it's not totally empty.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Is that grease on my floor?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: And?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: And we did.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I don't know.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Jim? Tell them what it's called.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: That's alright.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: No Jim, tell 'em what a name is.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Doesn't matter what the name is. Señor Loadenstein, that's stupid.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: [laughing] Señor Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: That's OK, we're good.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Jim...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No, Jim. Tell us why it's called Señor Loadenstein.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Porque es muy rapido.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Let me see it.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It's uh, it's in beta testing.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Let me see it!<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight, Erin, Jim &amp; Kevin</strong>: Uno! Dos! Tres! [sh*t shows Jim &amp; Dwight pulling ropes attached to a plank holding Erin in a helmet and boxes of paper down the greased runway, Dwight grunts]<br>

      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Just like now.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [laughs] Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.<br>

      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: That's right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Well, uh... see, you raised it.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim's desk while he's away in Philly. Finally I'll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It's like, "Really, Jim? You don't understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses." Wow.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: You know what, man? I deserve this job.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Mm-hmm.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond... and under.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You know what? You're gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you're going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Clark has no chance. I mean, he's up against my buddy Rolf, for God's sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor – he'll make you laugh so hard, you'll puke your pants.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You could've just called that an alliance too, right?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I chose my words very carefully.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that's only gonna make things worse.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: [sighs] You interviewing for the sales job too?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Rolf</strong>: No. You're interviewing for it. I'm getting it.
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Well, I wouldn't be so sure about that. I mean, I've been working here 12 weeks. That's a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we've seen.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Rolf</strong>: I'm Rolf. Rolf Ahl.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Rolf</strong>: Go to hell.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: There he is.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Hey. Come on, buddy. Let's do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first. You don't compare. When you're with the R-O-L-F, you're literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Rolf</strong>: Nice.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.<br>

      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: When are you talking to David Wallace?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I'm talking to him this afternoon, but don't get your hopes up.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Too late. My hopes are up.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we're scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix – me asking the boss of the company I'm abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So... problem solved. Thanks, guys.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: And this chair's gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No doy!<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I'm just gonna call you back. Thanks.<br>
      <br>
      [Dwight knocking on desk]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Rolf</strong>: I hope you like Norwegian black metal, because I don't do earbuds.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [laughs] No earbuds! [both laugh]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I'm sure he's just nervous.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [sighs] It's fine. It's just a seating arrangement. Doesn't matter.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: So I've got your resume here, but it's not telling me everything.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Rolf</strong>: Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you're qualified to evaluate me?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Well, I'm the one offering the job.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Rolf</strong>: What are your credentials?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I've worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I'm an Assistant to the Regional Manager.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Rolf</strong>: I think I've heard everything I need to hear.
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I'm sure he'd give a reference.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Rolf</strong>: Thank you, Dwight. I'll be in touch.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Well, they can't all be winners. But Trevor's next and he's a real professional. You say, "Jump," and he says, "Oh who?" He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: What makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Trevor</strong>: Ooh, okay. Didn't see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Well, it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Trevor</strong>: Pass. Next one.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Trevor</strong>: No, no and no.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: There were only two options.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Trevor</strong>: Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: This is a bus transfer.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Trevor</strong>: [chuckles] Nothing gets by this guy.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Sure, yeah, go ahead.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Thanks, dude. You—you sure it's okay? ‘Cause you're kinda—<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah, absolutely. Do people like sitting next to you? You're clean, right?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Oh, Dove Men.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don't listen to it at all because we're at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so—<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Thanks, dude.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Why?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I need you to breathe in my face right now.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: [exhales]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Wintergreen.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I knew it, I knew it.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Yeah, good nose.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I looked at you coming around, and I said, "Wintergreen."<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I can't hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Okay, here's one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock. You can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: That's just a classic no-win situation.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Thank you.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: So I'd Kobayashi Maru it.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Damn it! Perfect answer, again.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Yep.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond ...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: You know what, Dwight?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: And anoth—<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: This interview's over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru'd the whole process.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Yeah. Star Trek rules.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It does, but still no.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh, you think they're my only friends? I've got way more friends than that, and they're all better than the losers who work here.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      [all murmuring]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: This is not natural.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Just – I don't wanna make assumptions based on people's physical appearances.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: They smell so bad.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: If I ever get that bad, you'd tell me, right?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Meredith, I tell you all the time.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: [chuckles] Walked right into that one.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He's got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I've got big expectations, Mose-wise.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: What quality would make you a good sales associate?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Mose</strong>: People person.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Mose</strong>: That's right.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You know we live together, right?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Mose</strong>: Yes.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: And I've never seen you go to work, ever.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Mose</strong>: Okay.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: So why is this on your resume? [door slams]<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: So how'd you guys hear about the position?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Gabor</strong>: My—my mom.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Nate</strong>: Dwight called my house, but he didn't realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I- I can't stay out of her stuff.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Zeke</strong>: Dwight's my cousin, so I overheard him telling my brother Mose about the job opportunity in the shower.
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: You were in the shower or he was in the shower?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Zeke</strong>: Everyone was in the shower. It's a cow shower, so there's like, a ton of people in there.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: So you guys all know Dwight already?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Melvina</strong>: I was his babysitter, and then we dated for a while. He was a passionate lover and the sweetest little baby.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Gabor</strong>: I knew you looked familiar. You used to pick up Dwight from school.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Melvina</strong>: You went to X-Men school too? [exhales]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: X-Men school?<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out.<br>
      
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Gabor</strong>: Oh, I have a few powers. Night hearing. Dogs understand where I point. And our training included picking carrots, scrubbing tubs, sewing imitation Levi's. A lot of telemarketing.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I don't want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn't work then. And now look what he's doing to us.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Nellie</strong>: Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: How is it my fault?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Nellie</strong>: Here's an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: But it's Dwight who's bring in all the weirdos.
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Yeah, but Jim, Dwight's a weirdo. We can't blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hey, I'm the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim's away. I'm in a position where I'm rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. [sighs] Forget it. I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">David Wallace</strong>: [on phone] Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input—<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don't lie. I can tell if you're lying.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">David Wallace</strong>: Hey, Dwight. It's David.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: David.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">David Wallace</strong>: Jim says he'd like some say in the hiring process.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Really? That's interesting. ‘Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day. And frankly, k*ll it lately.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife—
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">David Wallace</strong>: Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh. Um...<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">David Wallace</strong>: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay. I can't say that that's not fair.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Sounds fair to me, David.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">David Wallace</strong>: And I know we have a call scheduled for later –<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, yeah, so we'll just do that later.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No. Why not do it now?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">David Wallace</strong>: Yeah. What's up Jim?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Uh... [clears throat] Well, it's about Athlead. I'm sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I'd love to be in the loop, David.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">David Wallace</strong>: It's okay. Go ahead, Jim.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: There's a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor –<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">David Wallace</strong>: Okay. Jim, I'm gonna have to stop you right there.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yes, okay. Bye.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [whispers] I'd love to invest.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, thanks.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I'd like to give you $100 million. [snickers] [phone ringing]<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Hide</strong>: Why you make trees into bushes? You don't make paper from bushes.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hide, they're giving out jobs upstairs. Why don't you go up and get one?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Hide</strong>: Thank you.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah.<br>

      <strong class="text-strong">Troy</strong>: Whoops.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Zeke</strong>: [patting Darryl's hair] It's dense. Like bread.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Dwight, you can't just hire someone ‘cause they're your friend.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I'm not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Nellie</strong>: They're freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into masturbating.<br>

      <strong class="text-strong">Wolf</strong>: Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of ‘em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Wolf</strong>: Do you want this paper?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I sure do.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Wolf</strong>: It's not very good.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I will pay you whatever it takes.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Wolf</strong>: I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Wolf</strong>: Stop trying to get my paper buddy. Okay read my lips. It's over.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You're still at the 570 number?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Wolf</strong>: I am.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Okay. Good, good, good. [sighs]<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Hide</strong>: I have eight years experience selling electronics in Sanyo store in downtown Tokyo. I was a doctor. And I have a business degree from Tokyo University.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: This isn't gonna work out.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Hide</strong>: Thank you. [chuckles]<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He's a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I'm hesitant. Why can't I pull the trigger on any of them?<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. [knock at door]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Melvina</strong>: Do you need to be changed?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I do that myself now.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Melvina</strong>: Mm. Are you going to make a decision soon? I've been double-parked for five hours. I'm wondering if I should move my car.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No, you've been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Melvina</strong>: Well, the joke's on them. I live right next to the tow yard. All they did was save me some gas.
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Trevor</strong>: Hey man, we get how difficult this is. And no matter how you choose, we're still gonna be your friend.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Wolf</strong>: Yeah, whether it's me or Troy Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvina—<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Or none of you [chuckles]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Wolf</strong>: Yeah, you'd bring us all down here, put us through the wringer and then choose none of us.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Trevor</strong>: Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I wish I could hire all of you.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Zeke</strong>: I could start Monday.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I'm not looking south, I'm not livin'. That's what I always say.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Just act natural. [grunts]<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: And I was thinking it's only fair that you help make this decision since they'll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: But you know I wouldn't hire any of these all-stars.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it's your call.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn't picture any of them in the old gold and gray.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yes. Thank you. Amazed.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Sensei Ira</strong>: I'm sorry?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: What? This is such bullcrap!<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Wow. So much crap. It's just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Too much now.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Okay.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Nate</strong>: Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert's home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: That seems inconsiderate.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Rolf</strong>: No. We get it. Thanks so much for the opportunity, Dwight. Don't open any suspicious packages you may receive. No, wait. Do open them. Totally safe.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Guys, it wasn't up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn't my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Trevor</strong>: Well, my day's sh*t.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Rolf</strong>: Yeah, it's that weird hour where it's too late to start a slow roast and too early for a Swanson's.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Wolf</strong>: I got it. Paintball.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Trevor</strong>: [yelling] And what are we supposed to do until then?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Okay.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Wolf</strong>: Let's just go, you guys.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Rolf</strong>: Yeah. No limit on w*apon class, right?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: All right. I think that went well.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that'll print out—Hey. Meet your new desk mate.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: What's up good lookin'?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, cool. Hey Clark.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay. I'm really sorry I told the guys I'd be there for the board meeting.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Of course.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I'll call you when I get there.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: All right.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Bye.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Take care of my wife. I will be back.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Hey, Pam, I'm going to the kitchen. You want anything?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I'm good.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh, hey, I'll take a coffee.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Oh, I'm sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [scoffs]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Who, me?<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Us.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Absolutely, I do. [giggles]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I'll distract him, you take that.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that's great.<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [shushes]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam &amp; Dwight</strong>: [laughs]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Aah!<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: No!<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Welcome to the club, pig! [laughs]<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, Dwight!<br>
      <br>
      <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Aah!<br>
      
      <hr>
      
      <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I'm gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.</div>`,

Jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk. It's soy. [walks into bedroom, Jan sleeping on bed] This is why I do it, that's what I have to come home to. [sighs] She probably won't be up for a few hours.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: This is going to be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protege Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Um... Andy and Dwight are rockin' the sales team. I feel very blessed. [slams on breaks, camera turns, Meredith rolls off the hood]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">IT Tech Guy</strong>: You know generally it's not a good idea to click on offers that you haven't requested. What was the exact offer?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: It was for a video.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">IT Tech Guy</strong>: Yeah, what kind of video?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: A celebrity sex tape.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Really, what kind of celebrity?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Not relevant.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: How much did you pay for it?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Not relevant.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You paid for it?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: It all happened so fast.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Are you kidding me?<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Cool.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Well have fun with that.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: What?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Where?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: So she's really going to be fine?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Thank God you were there.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Did you see who did it?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No need we can just check the security tapes.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Who was driving?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, Michael.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It's only Meredith.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a m*rder or something.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Hey... Why did you do it?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: It was an accident.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Was she talkin' back?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Who's we, you and Jim?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Oh, I bet Jim goes too.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah, I haven't asked him yet.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Oh, I bet you ask?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I was planning on it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I bet you were.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Angela?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: [whispers to Kevin] Subtle.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: What<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [to Angela] Are you coming?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I can't, Sprinkles is sick.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Can't your other cats keep her company.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [sighs] All right!<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: My lord my liege.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Yes Michael?<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Back? Why is that Michael?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Oh! Did you do this on purpose?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Did this happen on company property?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is: we are fine?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: [sigh]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: People keep calling me a "Wunderkind"; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Hey D.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Hey monkey, what's up?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Sure.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I have to visit the alchy.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I wouldn't put it past her.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: So what do you need me to do?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I wrote it out.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Mm-hmm.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: There's a diabetes sh*t, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ok, I have an announcement.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: You pushed Darryl out the window?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: You sh*t Dwight?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh good, so we don't have to work.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: So, like a freedom tree.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I can take 3 people.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I can also take 3 people.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: [to Kevin] Separate cars.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Pam.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Pam.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Excellent!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I was thinking that we...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Good work Pam.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: But...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants g*n?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: She looks awful.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I think she's awake.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No... She's in a coma.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: No.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK... Meredith, [hauntingly] Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: At the same time.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: Hello Meredith.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: This is weird.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go. [wraps them around her IV] Tie these up, cheer up your tubes... [IV pops out] Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Whoa!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Nurse.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [groaning] I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke.
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: What, what are you doing? Just gimme that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Thanks.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: [applauds]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Does it hurt terribly?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: Oh really, what kind? Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, Fentanyl, Oxycontin, Palladone? What...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: I have no idea.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: Oh. [laughs]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Michael, I'm not gonna do that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well, just shhhh... just just...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: You cracked my pelvis<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Look, I just... I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: You're not forgiven.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Michael! Michael!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: [screams]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Hey.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Hey monkey.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Any problems?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: What!?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Sparkles, the white one, is dead.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Sprinkles.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: That was the sick one, right?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [sobbing]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Alright.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [still sobbing]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [to Angela] It's gonna be OK.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Michael, Angela's cat died.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Sprinkles?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [nods]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [sighs] Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the p*rn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Like what?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: That's cool.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: She's only a cat.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: You never... you don't like them.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Dwight please!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No, I have not.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I do not respect her, but I will go.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs...
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: I'm... um, Catholic.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Presbyterian.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Alright.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh me too.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Oh?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [puts hand up for high five] Same religion.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Alright! [high fives Pam]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: That's why we're cursed.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower, but you make more money as a leader.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: That's Buddhist.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Are you sure?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: No.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What are you?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">IT Tech Guy</strong>: Well if you're going to reduce my identity to my religion then I'm Sikh, but I also like Hip-hop and NPR, and I'm restoring a 1967 Corvette in my spare time.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK, 1 Sikh, and...<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Don't pull any plugs.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Intern</strong>: How are you doing Ms. Palmer?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Better.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Intern</strong>: Excellent.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Intern</strong>: Um... I'm an intern, which makes me a doctor, but...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Intern</strong>: Ah, so uh... so that is where her uterus went... Um, Ms. Palmer, your last tetanus sh*t was when you were bitten by a bat a few months ago?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Just doing my job.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Intern</strong>: It also says you were recently bitten by a raccoon?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: And a rat. Separate occasions.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. [sighs] And it's not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense... God is dead.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I will do some research.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I can help you with that.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh God, Rabies?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Mm-hmm.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: This place is so cursed.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to b*at rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [walks out into the office] I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Six of one, really.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people! [Kevin claps] Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad?<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: [Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&amp;J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [Pam's car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road] I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. [Jim gets into the passenger side] Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. [Jim leans over and kisses Pam] Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Pro-Am.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Pro-Am race for the... They hung up.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: [on the phone] No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: Zero.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Isn't that your money?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Oh, it's coming.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Michael?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: You cannot make me run.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK. [walks away]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Alright, alright.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: You didn't run for me...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Shhh...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: ...when I thought I had skin cancer.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: No.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [in bathroom] I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions. [tapes a cotton ball to each nipple]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Hey Angela. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your cat. [Angela starts to cry]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: What's wrong?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight k*ll my cat.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hmm...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Ah.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Angela, I'm sorry.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Did Roy ever k*ll one of your cats?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I'm more of a dog person.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [sighs]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: So what's your strategy for this race?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Well I'm gonna start fast.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Mm-hmm.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: What?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Then I'm gonna end fast.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Why won't more people do that? [laughs]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Cause they're just stupid.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [looks at camera] What?<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah... That was um...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah, I gave him a ride home because...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Right!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: ... We're dating.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wow! There it is.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. [looks at Jim] Right?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: It is going really great.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [Angela runs into Dwight] Oww!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Shut up.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Oh, really?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [pushes her chair into Dwight's legs] I'm not depressed I'm in grief.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Giant check it is.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yep.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Bat birth control<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Which we are.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What about a rabies nurse?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I don't think so.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That's possible. Look into that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Come in.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hey.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hey, hey, hey<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh my God.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What are you doing?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You said come in!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No I didn't, just please don't...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh my God.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: So I closed the door but the image of his...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Baquette.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: ... dangling participle...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Eww.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: ... still b*rned in my eyes.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I can imagine.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [Michael knocks slowly on door] Come in.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: May I enter the room?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yes. Or come in.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: European offices are naked all the time.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: They're so not.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [sighs] Gross.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: OK, name please.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: Creed Bratton, 75 plus division.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: You're over 75 years old?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: 82 November first. How much is the prize money?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: There's no prize money.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: What, is any of this real?<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Check that out. [points to Toby] Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here?<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: What? Look, no it was not...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. [turns around a picture of Meredith in the hospital] That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent k*ll. No, it is the foaming barking k*ll. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: [feeding a squirrel] I'm giving him a peanut.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Look how happy he is.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? [Elizabeth walks up in nurse's outfit] This is the reason we're here.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Elizabeth</strong>: Hello Michael.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Elizabeth</strong>: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Elizabeth</strong>: Great. [everyone claps]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You got it?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Mm-hmm.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: On your marks, get set...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [pulls Toby's pants down] Beow!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Hey! [extremely loud g*n]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: On your left!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: You're doing great Michael, look at you go!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: That's my boss! Yeah-ha baby!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot. [Creed, Stanley, and Oscar get into a cab]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance. [running right behind Kevin]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah. [laughs] Oh we're in last place.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, would you look at that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Darn it.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: Michael that's irrational.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Oh God! My nipples, it's starting.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: [Creed, Stanley, and Oscar sitting at a table] Can we get another round?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Waitress</strong>: OK.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: Thanks.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: So we've got what, another 20 minutes?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: More or less.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: Hmmm...<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [laughs] Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I don't know I'm really committed to winning.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Mmm... Yes.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: That's what I thought.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Right. Let's do some good.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: [Ryan looks at the phone as it rings... [Pam's voice] [You have reached the offices of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott, DM FM PMC rabies awareness Pro-Am fun run race... [Michael's voice] for the cure... [Pam's voice] leave a message" Ryan hangs up]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [Burp] Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch. [groans]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [runs into the back of Kevin] Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Back off me.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: How ya feeling, better?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: No.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I am a farmer Angela.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: What does that mean?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: You did k*ll her!?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I... I sang her, her favorite songs.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: You put her in my freezer.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Well I'm not responsible for that!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: You! [hits Dwight]<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It's OK.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: It's OK.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It's nothing, I'm robbing her.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: It's nothing.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It's fine. What?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: How could you do that without telling me?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: You don't understand.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [runs by] Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Don't touch me Dwight! [runs off crying]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [holding lamp] You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, and I get to carry it.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: [crosses finish line] And the winner is Toby Flenderson.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Have a seat, I'll write it down.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Where are we?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: He couldn't have made it a circle?<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [bent over] I am not going to finish. I can't b*at rabies. Nobody can b*at rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could b*at it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line]<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: ...talk about it.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Well, you're probably dehydrated.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What do you want me to do Jim?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Glass of water would be a start.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I'm still having a nice day.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You are?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That's a good deal.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I know you Michael, I saw you naked.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k [gets up groaning, Jim tries to help] No, no!<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that.<br>

<hr>

<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Hey Michael.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hey Mer. How ya doing?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Better.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore. [sighs, takes sucker out of his mouth] Wanna share?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Sure.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'm not really sick. [Meredith takes a lick and hands back to Michael] Nah, I'm good.</div>`,

    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Dwight, what uh...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Well, get it out of here.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Merry Christmas Dwight.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Jim.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wow. What have we got here?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: What does it look like?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Dead goose.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: And circle gets the square.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: All right.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Oh, Dwight, we talked about this.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it k*ll.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wow. Win-Win.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Exactly. Thank you, Jim.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: That's crazy. It's crazy.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Dwight, you cannot keep that here.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It's Christmas Toby.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: It's a dead animal in an office. You can't...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Toby...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: I'm sorry.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [sighs] Please? Please?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Clean it in your car.<br>
    <br>

[Struggling to stay on] 'Tis the ... ack. [expletive] Hey! [to Pam] I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Can I help you, Michael?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'm looking for the toy drive box.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: It's behind you.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK... Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wow. What kind of bike is that?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Umm... I don't know? Average kind?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: The tires look pretty worn.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well, that is probably from the test drive.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No.<br>

    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [hands over bag] I didn't, it's from corporate.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK. Did everybody get one of these?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yup.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Terrific. Good.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her. [singing] I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um, taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy <em class="text-italics">in</em> the box, Creed.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: And a happy holiday to you.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: Hi, is Michael around here?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello [kisses Carol] You're about five hours early to the party. You're such a blonde. [laughs]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: Michael.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: [whispers] What?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Turn around, turn around. Come on. [making a body turning gesture]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: Get outta here.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, you get outta here.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Michael<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [standing up] Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Thank you.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: I really need a moment alone with you. [Carol heads towards Michael's office.]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Not as much as I need a moment alone with you. [puts finger on her back and reaches for her butt] Berp.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: What is this? [Holds up a Christmas photo]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: No. See, we never went on a ski trip.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I know.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: I went on a ski trip.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Right.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: Michael.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: And next to your kids. What?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: This is so weird.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I don't understand?<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word?<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: I think you're a really sweet guy.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: But, um, I don't know how to deal with, with this thing [waves Christmas card]. And, and the proposal. And I don't think things are going to work out with us.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in [making drum noise] Jamaica's largest fresh water pool.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: What are you talking about?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. [Carol shakes head in disappointment]. You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: Oh, no. Michael.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: And it's all inclusive.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: Michael...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Carol</strong>: I'm sorry.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Psst. Jim. [Jim turns around. Pam nods head towards her for him to come over] Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: What?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. [hands a folder to Jim]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Are you serious?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [Opens folder and reads from Dwight's file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. [Jim smiles] Sorry I didn't wrap it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, because of the promotion.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh yeah.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: It just feels a little bit, like...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, I get it, of course. OK. [holds out hand for folder. Jim gives Pam back the folder.]<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: You can't cancel a holiday.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: What does that mean?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Michael, what's going on?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Will they still air 'Rudolph?'<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: That's not fair.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [over everybody else's talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Fine! [everybody stops talking] Have your party. Just no guests.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: But we invited guests.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I know.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: OK, well, why are you laying like that?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [moves a little] Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Like what?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Well.. um I, I don't...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I don't need to know.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Take it from Toby.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Copy.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, thank you.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: It's all... [Pam walks away.] OK.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- [Dwight grabs bag with robe in it and walks away.] Why?<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: I thought you said green was whorish.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: No, orange is whorish.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... [Phyllis and Pam nod their heads in agreement].<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: It would never work here.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: No.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: A Christmas drinking game ...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Yes.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: God help you.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: What?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of "A Nutcracker Christmas." I think you should leave.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: You're kidding.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What are you doing? ["Goodbye My Lover" by James Blunt plays]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Hey, what's the haps? [Dwight shuts door in his face.]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Carol?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to "Goodbye My Lover" on computer]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Why don't you just buy the whole song?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. [Continues to sift through papers] But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [singing] Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. [hits repeat again]<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Um, usually like that.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. [both laugh]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Right.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Um, I really liked your karaoke idea.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Oh cool, yeah.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: That could really be fun.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Oh, thank you.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You guys do a raffle?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Yeah, we do a raffle...<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Hey Kev.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin's back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.]<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: This should've been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: It'll be all right.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The "Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?" There's no such thing as the "Committee to Plan Parties."<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: There is now. We just started it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: What's your funding?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Two hundred dollars.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: What's ours again?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Umm, two hundred and one dollars.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh right.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: [pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Then why are there two flyers?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Right.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. [Angela rips down brightly colored flyer and walks away. Karen rips down Angela's flyer.]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I didn't see where it was.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: I think that's a really good option...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You can't do that.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: As ranking number three in this office, I am order -<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Umm... I'm number three.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You're number four.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yeah, but I'm number three.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Ah, no. [to Pam and Karen] You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: OK, I think I can help here.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Ok, good<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: OK, this is stupid.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Permission denied.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Damn it!<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. [Michael sighs.] C'mon, my treat.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hooters?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too. [do a fist bump and expl*si*n]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ah, I need my entourage [both exit Michael's office] Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Ah man, I can't.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Why not?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan's forehead]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ok, feel better.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Thanks.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: C'mon Jim, let's go.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World w*r II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: So she looks really hot, so I said, "You look hotter than usual today." [to waitress] Thank you. Michael [gesturing to sit down.] Head of the table.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Get out Jim. [Dwight tries to sit between Andy and Jim] Actually, um... [to two other people at the table] Sir, I'm going to need take this chair.
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They're on a date. They look very happy.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: So she looks at me right, and she goes, "I'm sorry, don't I even know you?" After a year, a <em class="text-italics">year</em> of buying lattes from her, do you believe that?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yes.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I can't... I can't here what you're saying.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Carol used to drink lattes.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [off screen at other end of table] What're you talking about?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: She would get this little foam mustache...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [still off screen] Carol had a mustache?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: And I used to say "Hey, got latte?" And she'd say, that's not funny.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [off screen] What are you guys talking about?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy ---<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Michael! Repeat what you said louder!<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight's face]<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't, OK, I'm gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Who are you calling?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'm just gonna call her.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here, [to waitress] we need your help.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Waitress</strong>: What can I get for 'ya?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes. [waitress gives confused look]<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: You should, you should put out salt for the rims [referring to margaritas]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: That's a great idea.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Phyllis?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: I was just getting a snack.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You can have your snack in here.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: OK.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Roy</strong>: So I only use three?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Roy</strong>: OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Roy</strong>: OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh yeah, your mom would love that.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Roy</strong>: [Karen walks in] Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later. [leaves room]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Bye.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: He's cute. You should date him.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, yeah... Maybe.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Chef</strong>: No, it's Usuba.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Chef</strong>: Actually, the Usuba's the better knife when you're working with this quantity.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Woman at bar</strong>: I think he'd know. [Dwight and her stare at each other]<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Nothing he's doing is cheering me up.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Cindy</strong>: I don't know.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour. [Cindy laughs and walks away]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. [referring to what chef is doing] Watch, watch, watch, watch. [Onions smoke up] Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You're right. That's good.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside]<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention]
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: This drink... [in audible conversation with Michael]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Did Michael give you permission to do this?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [with conviction] Start the party.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Yup.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: [Stanley gets up and walks towards the break room.] All right Stanley. Woo.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Good choice. [Kelly drags Ryan to the break room.]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Hannah</strong>: Why would I be disappointed?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I said you wouldn't be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Is that a threat?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: No, it's an invitation.
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Lots of it! [Meredith leaves to break room party.]<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm...<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Brownies. Cupcakes. [Kevin walks toward conference room]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Don't push it.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. [Pam and Karen look at each other] What?<br>
    <br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef. [points to chef] Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. [leans over to neighboring man's plate] I see steak.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Man</strong>: Excuse me.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Excuse me [tries to take away meat with chopsticks] Ah, un guard. [Fights with chopsticks and laughs] Family style.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, it's not.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Cindy, Cindy.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I don't think... I love it!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house. [Cindy laughs] C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [laughing] I don't know what he's doing.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: This is great.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Jim! Jim! What... What's happening?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, [points to Cindy] she's asleep.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh... Narcolepsy.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Probably.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Now open your eyes and describe it to me.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Cindy</strong>: I... don't know, it has four bed rooms and a loft...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh my gosh, now she's up.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: What d'ya think? [to Stanley about his drink]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: Fruity and delicious.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: See, I told you. You want one Meredith?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: No thanks. They're too sweet.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Hey, so what's the status.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Looks like they forgot the power cord.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: What?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Oh, you're kidding me?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: No.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Oh, you guys, guys, um... I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine. [everyone sighs]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Well that blows.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer. [Everyone cheers]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Everybody</strong>: Darryl! Darryl! Darryl! [Darryl exits break room and passes Phyllis]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Hi.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... [looks inside conference room] meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Oh, ok.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: All right. Se you later...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Hannah</strong>: [tries to break nut on a Nutcracker doll] These nuts are really hard to crack.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: You've got to be kidding!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Cold, huh?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Huh? [puts on jacket]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there?<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [referring to waitresses] They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You know what we should do?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: What?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: We should invite them to the Christmas party.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, you are such mench my friend. [They stand up and do fist bump and expl*si*n]<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend. [Guys walk in with two different waitresses from Benihana's]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Second Cindy</strong>: That rocks.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Second Cindy</strong>: Thanks! I, I wanna give you something.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh. [She whispers in his ear. Michael starts to laugh] That's what she said.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: My new girlfriend.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Where's Dwight?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Second Cindy</strong>: Is he the hot one or the giant baby?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [whispers] The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: [under her breath] There's another party in the break room.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that? [refers to toy she just took from table]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Second Cindy</strong>: I thought I could have it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: You can't have it [takes back toy] I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Hey! It's Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: We're going to ...<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: [singing] I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but...<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos. [turns to reach for pretzel while Second Cindy turns other direction] And... my question to you [points and pulls away other waitress] is do you agree?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Other waitress</strong>: Do I agree about what?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Do you agree about what? [laughs] Wow. You're lucky you're so darn cute.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Other waitress</strong>: What're you talking about?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What're you talking about?<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: [singing] And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: All right [high fives Kevin]<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Did you have fun at Benihana's?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. [cheers from other party]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I've had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela's hand]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: [Karen and Pam enter] Dwight, you won the raffle! [holds out gift]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No... way! Yeah!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Open it! Open it ! Open it! [Dwight rips open present. Angela is upset and Pam notices]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Do you like it?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Walkie-talkies.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Can I talk to you a second?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yes!<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [holds up rice krispie shaped like a star] In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah, but we don't have a power cord.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Mmm. Hmm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Yeah, thanks.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: We'll go tell everyone.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: OK.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy and Michael</strong>: [singing] And if you want love, we'll make it. Swim in a big sea of blankets. Take all your big plans and break 'em. This is bound to take awhile. Your body is a wonderland. [Michael notices Cindy ride up to him on the bike and looks confused] Your body is a wonderland.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Your hands.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Both</strong>: Your body is a wonderland.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I'll use my hands on it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Both</strong>: Something 'bout the way your hair falls in your face...<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: [singing] Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: When you know, you just know.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Right.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Roy</strong>: Which one is she? [Michael stares at both waitresses]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: It's... it's one of those two. [points at both]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Roy</strong>: You don't know?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Dude, you should know.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like?<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Second Cindy</strong>: You know where I am.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile [marks Cindy's arm with a black marker]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Second Cindy</strong>: Oh.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: [singing] Spinnin' n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don't touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I'm crazy about 'ya...<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What's your twenty?<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: No way. [both hold up Bridget Jones' Diary movie DVD]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: What a horrible, horrible movie that was.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: And now we get to remember it forever.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Thank you.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Thank you. [Both hug]<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Second Cindy</strong>: Hey.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hey, hey, you. How are ya?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Second Cindy</strong>: Hey. This party blows, so we're gonna leave.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Second Cindy</strong>: Cool...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Where do you wanna go?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Second Cindy</strong>: I... We're just gonna take off.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Second Cindy</strong>: No... I have school. [leaves with other waitress and bicycle]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You want help? OK... Merry Christmas.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Second Cindy</strong>: Merry Christmas.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That waitress was the one.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No. She wasn't.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: How can you be sure?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Don't make fun... You're making fun of me.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Sorry.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You what?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I, I put a mark on her arm. [Both are laughing] So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, why do I feel like crap?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You just had a rebound.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I had rebound? Yeah.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I totally rebounded. Someone else sh**t and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually sh**ting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [singing, with Dwight holding up microphone] Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [on phone] Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive...<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [singing] ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.<br>

    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Night.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh no, that would be great.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: It costs seventy five dollars.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Ohh... [laughs]<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes.

  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Thirty-two meatballs.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: Good day.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: That idiot's been feeding us for a week.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: We'll never have to buy meatballs again.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: [phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Jessica! I love you! That's a message from my mom.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Oh, who needs a house that size?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: I'm selling the house, actually.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: It's mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and I've got the most expensive house on the market. The one percent are suffering too, people. I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, sex, intrigue... this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now she's left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? They're calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room. [Jim laughs] Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Oh yes. How hilarious it is to laugh at clowns, the painted jesters of the dying circus industry. Very funny, Jim. I get it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: A beautiful monster cost me my forties and my dream home. I think I'm entitled to the occasional bad day.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Kevin, no.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: What, as some sort of last hoorah?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: You know I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow. Let's try this: everyone, tonight, my house, wear a swimsuit. Let's just call it a get-together. And let's say no food.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: That was you, Kevin.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: It was me.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: It's no problem. You live right near me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: How do you know where I live?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Why?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Oh. Come on.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks]<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Cathy</strong>: It's almost too warm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Gabe</strong>: I'm feeling eighty-two, eighty-two and a half.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Oh, so close. Eighty-one.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Gabe</strong>: [to Cathy] Well, we'll say its eight-two and it'll be our secret.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Cathy</strong>: [to Jim] Hey, late guy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Oh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: You should see the whole thing.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: I'm just about to give the tour.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: All right-<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Join us. You must see what you were laughing about.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I must...<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jessica</strong>: [looks at pool] Wow.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [hides ring] Yeah, it's pretty serious poolage.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jessica</strong>: [sees Andy's hand in his pocket] What are you doing?
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jessica</strong>: Gross. I'm getting a drink. Do you want anything?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No, I'm good.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: [runs to Andy] Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Hi.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: How is everything? How's your car?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Oh, like a goodbye trip.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No. What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jessica</strong>: Hey.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Hi.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Val. You made it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Val</strong>: Yup, yup.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Val</strong>: You know, you are just as dumb at night.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Mmm. [they clink cups]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jessica</strong>: No, show me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jessica</strong>: Dive in right here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: In a minute. In a minute.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jessica</strong>: Okay. You don't know what you're doing.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: A minute would be cool.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Hey, Dwight Snoot.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: What-<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: What you doing?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I'm relaxing. Scram. [pushes her]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Ow.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Where... [finds pants, looks for ring]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Come on, don't you want to play?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh really?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Whoa.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Here we have the parlor. I imagined people would set down their coats and symbolically their inhibitions. This was the gateway. You enter this room a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a judge, but beyond it you're simply a penis, a vagina, hunger, ache. Susan used it as a Pilates studio.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: [sees wine collection] Holy cow!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Wine collection.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: How many bottles? Three hundred?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: [laughs] About twelve hundred. What the hell, grab a bottle. Less inventory for the lawyers.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Robert, you are too kind.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Oh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Gabe</strong>: Too kind doesn't begin to cover it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: With amm*nit*on like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Gabe</strong>: And Gabe-y makes three.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Jim, come see this next room. I think you especially would like it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Really? Why?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: I don't know. Maybe not. Just come.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: [Dwight dunks her] Oh!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: [giggles] Oh Dwight!<br>

  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: [giggles] Stop.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You stop.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: No, you stop.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No, you stop.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: [to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Okay, you can stop.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: No, no, no, he's not looking.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No, you can stop.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: You can actually stop.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: The main stone's missing.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: I don't know. It looks pretty great to me.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: I pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. Then I met the vegan.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Good night.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: [raises wine bottle] To the kitchen!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">All</strong>: To the kitchen!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: To the kitchen. Onward!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Note? It's a symphony.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: I would love that.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I'm through the gateway now, though, right?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: [to Val] You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Val</strong>: You in?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't b*rned off yet. Awkward stage.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Damn it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: What is the most romantic possible thing?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Both</strong>: Yes! [they high five and jump in the pool]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: You're in my way!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Chicken fight!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No thanks.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Dang it! What the heck already?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Cathy</strong>: Okay, yeah. Who's going to be my partner? Where's Jim?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yeah- oh!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: [knocks Cathy off Kevin's shoulders] Yes! Woo!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Woohoo! Yes!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I know. I could just bang you right now.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: He's not looking. [Dwight dumps her in the pool] Hey!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: To both these bears.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: To both these bears.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Bears.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: To both these bears.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: When I put in the screening room, I bought three movies: Caligula, Last Tango in Paris, and Emmanuelle 2. Last two movies I actually watched in here Marley and Me and On Golden [bleep] Pond.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Gabe</strong>: Yup. We could watch some right now if you want. I got a Korean film on my iPod if you want to just- if you have the cables.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Oh, I don't think you're being silly.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Oh God. [takes off ring]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: [snatches ring] Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jessica</strong>: [to Andy] Come on. Let's chicken fight those two.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Val</strong>: [comes up from under water] How was that?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Okay. Watch my toes. [does hand stand]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Val</strong>: No, I'm good. Thank you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Cool.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Val</strong>: Cool. [to Kevin] Does Darryl not swim?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: That's r*cist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jessica</strong>: [knocks Erin off Dwight's shoulders] Yes!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yeah!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: One more?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yeah!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jessica</strong>: Yeah! Great! [others cheer and clap]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Mush, mush, mush! Come on!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Go!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Go! Okay. Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jessica</strong>: Here we go! [knocks Erin over] Yes!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yay! [Erin comes back up] Whoa!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Wow!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I cannot believe you're still up!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jessica</strong>: I cannot believe it either.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I've got this! [Dwight gasps] Charge! Go! Go! [Dwight sinks]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [muffled] Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [coughs up water] Erin, did we win?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Sure. Sure we did.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You're lying. We didn't win.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets fire to paper ring boat]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: We're in the pool!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Shut it, Angela.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Mmm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Not what I asked.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: We're done. Erin and I are over.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [sighs] You're an idiot.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! [Val, Erin and Kevin play with pool noodles]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Uh-uh. Uh-uh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: No!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Val</strong>: Oh I've got him!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Darryl</strong>: Cannonball! [jumps in pool] Let's do this!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [Erin swims up with ring] Wow.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: The Bernard family seal. Duh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Duh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Sorry if your special night was ruined.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Oh, you weren't going to do that?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: To madness.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: To madness.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: To madness. [Robert laughs]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: To madness.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Are you serious?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Gabe</strong>: And that goes double for me. I'll stay even later than you'd like.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: [Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: And I am Bacchus's friend!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Gentlemen, bear witness. While I've been mourning the nights that never were, one of them has been unfolding here before me. This is no get-together. This is a party. [Robert strips, jumps in pool, Gabe and Ryan join him]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">All</strong>: Yes! Woohoo! Bravo!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: And there's my talking point.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert</strong>: Yes, that's it. Push yourselves, boys. It's not a party if you don't do something that scares you. I need a breather. Oh. Oh. You two keep going.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Hey, he's asleep. We can just leave.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Gabe</strong>: So leave.</div>`,

Yeah, I'm pregnant... Great, well, I'll write up the order. Okay, thanks.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Wait a minute! You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby? Oh, thank you very much. I'm excited. Oh, definitely.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No, no! You need to come by your sales honorably!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life. People like it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [on the phone with a client] Hey there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ... Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly. Okay.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I need a baby. I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one. Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life. Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Kevin, you're such a gourmand.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook. Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hmm.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot. Not all meals. Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner. One last ultra feast.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Mmmm, that sounds great. What are you thinking?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I think it should be a surprise.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: [After Pam has a contraction] Oh, getting there, huh?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, no. I still have time.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart. So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it. And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I cannot wait for that joke to be over.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Ooh.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Michael.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Michael, you shouldn't have done that.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You know the baby's not going to live here, right?
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here. Burning man, port-o-potty.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital!
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital. We are waiting until midnight.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Ooh, spooky. But why?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Because the insurance company only covers two nights.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Everything's fine. We have plenty of time.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nick</strong>: Well, you don't want to wait too long, Pam. Otherwise the baby's going to become a teenager in there and you'll be up all night, from the rock music.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say. Weird I.T. nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [as Nick looks over at her] What are you looking at?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Ha, nerd.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Did you know that labor can last weeks? Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [with Angela in the break room] Bare my child.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Excuse me?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother. If you agree, say nothing. If you disagree, say anything... Very well. Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [after Pam has another contraction] That's seven minutes. Here we go. This is happening. Come on.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hold on, hold on. It isn't midnight yet.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Are you serious? Pam.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I... Pam, please.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yeah, no, you really should. Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks. My old roommate.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Did you hear that? Butt-mud Brooks.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Five minutes apart.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: So, the plan was seven minutes. But we're calling an audible, because that's her call. Because she's the quarterback. I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, stop watching me.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay, crazy. I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Mm-hmm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal. While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Not until midnight.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Guys. Word of advice. Speaking as a former baby. Don't get too hung up on baby names. I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him. I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You know, it's getting real crowded in here. Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [as Andy and Kevin shout "yeah!" in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Actually, the distractions are good. I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Distractions are good! That means conference room, five minutes! No, no, five seconds! Right now, right now! Conference room! Topic, potpourri! Let's go!<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Um, I am sort of a master of distraction. When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class. Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. [Michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises.]<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Can we do sleight of hand tricks?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I will allow that.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yes! Can anyone do those?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: I'm going to go look at the Internet.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [as Pam has another contraction] Oh! Oh, alright. That's a good one.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys. Just, um, keep talking.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, thanks, Kelly.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Does anybody have anything? Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes, Phyl?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [ as Pam shakes her head] Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I can do the evolution of dance-dance.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [as Pam gives the thumbs up] That sounds good! Do you need some music, or...? Okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Nope, actually music would just throw me off. I need complete silence. Okay... [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances] You're clapping. I need complete silence. Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over. Evolution of dance-dance.
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: [reading from a book as Kelly admires] "You let me in your bed. But now, I sleep alone. Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home."<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: [naming race horses] Affirmed. Seattle Slew. Secretariat. Citation. as*ault. Count Fleet. Rollaway. w*r Admiral. Omaha. Gallant Fox... And... I know this. Uh... The jockey was Johnny Loftus. Sired by Star sh**t.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Good afternoon.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Have a seat.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: What is this?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Of course.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: You know I was thinking...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Now, then. Let's get to it, shall we? Item one[/b]: [speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus. Agreed?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Agreed.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [as Pam has another contraction] Where are we? We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay, you know what? I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call. He'd probably know...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Jim, please. Happy thoughts here. Happy times.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor. And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor. Erin, read the first one.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Um, stimulate the nipples.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples. Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Her shirt is touching them. Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: I have a shirt like that in my car.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Okay, uh, the second one is walk around. We're already doing the opposite of that. Perfect. Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, the opposite of that?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Stick spicy food up her butt.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Nope, nope, nope, nope. Come on, let's go to the hospital. Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Mm-hmm. Okay, great. Well, sorry.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Why don't you go do some work?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Great. I will do that. Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled. And you know how very rarely I use that word. Frazzled.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I know, you don't like to be frazzled.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, I don't.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now. Totally.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ooh, someone's freakin'.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: A little frazzled.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I think he is.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy, she's crazy. I'm not crazy, she's crazy. [reading from various books] Five to seven minutes. Five to seven minutes. Six minutes. Different, but not really. Five to seven minutes.<br>

    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Okay. Fine.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: What if it's a girl?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Irrelevant question. Section 5A, child shall be male.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Hey. Uh-uh. I cannot control that. You can't put that in here.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yes you can.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: No.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Absolutely not.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [Pam approaches as he sits in his car] Hey.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hey. I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Ah, you know me too well.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, Jim.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah? ... Oh.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Everything is fine. You don't have to worry. Try not to think about it. She's not coming out for a while, okay?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Did you say "she?"<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I called the doctor like a week ago. I couldn't wait... Oh, God, don't be mad.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Mad? How could I be mad? We're having a little girl.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Mm-hmm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wow, we're having a little girl. Oh, man.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I know.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Woo, alright. Well, I definitely feel better.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Good.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright... Hey, did you change?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, yeah, my water broke.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh. Oh...<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [enters the office and has another contraction] Oh, whoa. Ha. Wow.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Pam, Pam! Okay, alright, okay, it's time. Time to go to the hospital. Somebody get Jim, please! Is it midnight yet?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: No, it's 4:35.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: 4:35. Alright, almost made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn't have sex like seven and a half hours later. But you had to have the afternoon delight. I understand. Sometimes you have to go for it. Let's go to the hospital, shall we?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, not yet, Michael.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: We can do...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast! Where's Kevin?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh. What? You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: That's fancy feast. Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What is October feast?<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: There is no rush to get to the hospital. I am fine. I'll get there. And if I don't get there, I don't get there.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Our ultra feast menu's theme[/b]: Hollywood. We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels. I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I... Are you okay?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm fine. Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright. Time to go. Okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That's right, let's do this.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Let's give it a sh*t.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Nope. No, no, that's better. That wasn't even the worst of them. I'm fine.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey, come on. Let's go to the hospital.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: They're not that bad still, babe.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Pam, Pam, it's time. Let's go to the hospital.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, it's passing, it's fine. It's okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Come on, Michael says we should go now.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Let's go, Pam. Yeah, I think we should head out.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, it's passing, it's fine.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Pam.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Ah, no, it passed. It's good.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You know what? Let's go. We got to go to the hospital.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, I'm not going. I'm not... It's fine. [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on. No! I am not going! I am not going, okay!? I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey, are you kidding me?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Are you kidding?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: If anyone can do this, you can do this.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You can do this. You can do this.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Pam, I'm scared. I'm real scared.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'm scared, too.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I'm petrified.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: A really awesome baby.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: We're going to have a baby.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: So let's have it at the hospital.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Let's do that.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: How are we doing on contractions?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Two minutes apart.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Two minutes...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, God. Oh, no.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Michael, I told you.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: It's okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Jim, we waited too long!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I know, I know, I know. It went by too soon.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: We waited too long! Two minutes doesn't do us any good. Well, what happened to four and three minutes?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: We're okay, Jim! Okay, Pamela. You know what time it is?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I don't want to have my baby here.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You're not going to. You know where you're going?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: The hospital.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes, you are. And you know what you're going to have?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: A baby.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes! We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I got it! I got it! Everybody it's go time! At your stations. Stanley, man the phones. Meredith, please, get bottled water. Erin, call an ambulance, please!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call an ambulance, I call the cops.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check! Got it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright, I have my wallet.<br>
    <br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Go bag! Where's my go bag? Where's my go bag?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: There's nothing in it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You are telling me now that there is nothing in it. Okay, great! Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Has anyone checked how dilated she is? This is ridiculous!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Dwight, get away!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, no, no. Dwight, let Jim do that, please.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I didn't know we had a tape measure.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] "We" don't.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay, I can't find my keys! I cannot find my keys! Found 'em. They're here.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight, Jim and Michael</strong>: Here we go!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Good luck!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nick</strong>: Good luck, Pam!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Thank you! Wish me luck!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: Have fun! [sigh]<br>

    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Come on, Stanley! Okay. We're going now!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Oh, one more!<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Dwight, what is the traffic like?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Doesn't matter. I'll escort you!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Alright.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Let's go!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Geesh, Dwight!<br>

    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What!?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: This is where I saw that deer last week.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Where?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Right over by that fence.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: By the bushes?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay, Michael! Focus!<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, go, go, go, go!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Let's go!<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. I got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright, here we go! You're doing great! She'll be here soon.<br>

    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Stop texting, put your phone away! Come on.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Michael, come on!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'm texting about you, okay!?<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Ugh, alright. [as he puts a police siren on top of his car] Let's move! ... What?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Policeman</strong>: Pull over!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Are you kidding me?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Policeman</strong>: Pull over! [Dwight begins throwing various w*apon out of the window] You're not allowed to impersonate a police officer! Don't make this difficult, Dwight!<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Wait, wait. My iPod's not in here!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: It has the birth song on it!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay. I know, I know. But my iPod is in the go bag. We'll be fine.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay, so what do you want to do?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I don't know! Let's go by the house and get it. It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Pam, no! Are you nuts? We're going to the hospital now.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Guys, guys! Stop fighting, come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go. [as he calls Dwight] Ready?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Dwight Schrute.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hello, Dwight. Pam left her iPod at her house. I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital. We need it yesterday.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday? I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Dwight! Go to my house. Get my iPod. I think it's on the kitchen table. Do not touch anything else. The key is under...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I don't need a key.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the...<br>

    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Michael, just go park the car.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, alright. [he parks in an ambulance zone]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Hospital employee</strong>: Sir! You can't park here!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Dunder-Mifflin. It's okay. [he throws the keys into bushes across the street] I just did.<br>
  
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Pam's doing great. Uh, she's ten inches dilated now. Uh, sorry, meters. Centimeters. And she's also fully faced. Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet. It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Daddy? She's ready to push.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Where is my little nibblet? Halpert, room D1. Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you. Here we go.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [as Pam screams] Doing great, push again.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Doctor</strong>: Not yet.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, don't push. Pull. Pull.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Why don't you get more ice chips?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, Jim, stay!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Doctor</strong>: Okay. Really push this time, Pam.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [looking horrified as he walks from the room back into the lobby] Okay, not yet, not yet. I'm going to go wash my eyes.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: She hasn't popped yet.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: What? God damn it. She was supposed to come out yesterday.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born. This frame set me back fifty five bones. But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: This is ridiculous. We just can't wait here.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I think it's going to be any minute now.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: But you don't know that. I mean, we could be here another half an hour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: I have an ice cream cake in the car.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, my God. Go, go, go! Are you insane? Alright.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [Pam screams as he approaches the door to their room] Guys? Hello? Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna...<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: This is happening!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You're starting, you're kinda losing them.<br>
    <br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [with Jim, holding the baby] She's incredible. Want to count her fingers and toes again?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, let's let her rest. I'm sure there's still twelve on each.<br>

    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches. Mother and daughter are doing great.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Everyone</strong>: Yeah!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Thank you! Thank you!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Congratulations. That's great.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">(Pam's mom) Heleen</strong>: Hi there.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey, grandma's back.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Helene</strong>: Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Great.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, thank God. I haven't had caffeine in nine months.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Helene</strong>: Ooh, somebody has a full diaper.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh. Let me get it.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I am a diapering master. I have done little else in the past two months. There is nothing I cannot diaper. Go ahead. Try to think of something. I dare you.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Where's the baby? I want to see the baby. Oh! Oh, Helene, hi. Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this? Congratulations on being a grandma.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Helene</strong>: Hello, Michael.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hello. Oh, good for you. I worry about you.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Helene</strong>: I'm, uh... You know I think, uh, I think it's time for me to go.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Helene</strong>: Love you.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Love you, as a friend.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Love you, mom.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ooh, I want to hold the baby!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Alright.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Again, no pants.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Ready?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod. I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it. What I did find, was mold, and lots of it. So, I did what anyone would do. Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it. I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets... Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: There she sat. Her name was Pam. She was a receptionist. She was engaged to an animal. There sat Jim. He was a gawky, tall salesman. The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able. I made a family! I got these two together, and I made a family.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: This man has a gift!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Who else here is single?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: I'm not single. I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I am offering up my services to you all. You saw what I did with Pam and Jim. I can help you, too.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any? [Stanley raises his hand] Who else? Come on! People, I know models!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ha ha, you got that right! Meredith? Come on, you're obviously single.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: You know it. I am never getting married.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Like Clooney.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Andrew, what about you?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Torn scrotum. Still on the mend, so not good timing.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin. I'm just waiting for the stars to align. Literally. I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well, when you least expect it, expect it. I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love. I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person. And, like Cupid, I am going to sh**t you with love.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: We were just kids. What did we know?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: How we doing?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Great.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Good.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Doesn't she sleep here?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: She can. But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest. You've been through a lot.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I think we'll be okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Okay, great.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [as the baby yawns] Oh, big yawn.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Ready? One, two, three...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: One, and then wrap around. It's okay. Hold that arm down.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I can't. She's too strong. She's, careful, though. You don't want to break it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: She's not gonna... Just...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I got it. Alright.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Go.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Nurse!<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: How you doing?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I don't know. I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Really?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Doesn't feel right.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: How does one do that?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wasn't it... It's kinda like a... Like that.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Do you want to try it, Jim?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I think you're good. Doing a good job.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Somebody buzzed?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh! Really? Must have sat on it, Pam.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I can't tell if she's getting anything. It just doesn't really feel right.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while. I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Even if she's not getting anything?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Yeah, she'll be fine. I can always give her a bottle since we're in the nursery.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No. I read in the book about nipple confusion.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Oh, good. You know everything.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Well, I'll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Alright.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: It's going to be alright.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Ha ha. No, yeah, that will be good.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: [in Michael's office] You wanted to see me?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Oh, boy! ... What's that sound?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: [as he appears from behind the door] Ta-da!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yes!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I don't know what to say.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Oh, say nothing. You will learn to love me.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth. Why don't you guys get to know each other? Maybe have lunch together?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Erin, would you have lunch with me?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Good!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yes!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Michael, could I talk to you privately?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Sure. Kevin, please leave.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Bye.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Bye.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not. I like Andy.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay. This is going to k*ll Kevin.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I'm sure he'll be fine.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'm not so sure. Kevin has an enormous heart. Literally, he has an elephant heart. He had a transplant when he was seventeen. Had some problems, blah blah blah.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Really?<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart. But he is very sensitive. And it won't k*ll Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him... I bet his heart is enlarged, though.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I don't want anyone to die.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Just don't let him sit on you... I'm kidding. You'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good. There he is. Go to him.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Hi.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Hi.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: She touched my shoulder.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Hey, guys. We're short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, hi.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kathy</strong>: Hi.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dale</strong>: Hi, so sorry.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Careful... Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I know.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You see that? I'm pretty sure she's... Hi.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Did you grow up around here?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: No.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yes.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Why was I hiding behind the plant? Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class. Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class. And then, uh, they would say things like "Oh, this guy's going to fail this class," or, "What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?" And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, "Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people? Busted." ... Oh, the reason? The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and... I was jealous.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Hospital employee</strong>: Hi. I'm Clark. Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Um, yeah, that would be great.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yup. Really great. When's she available?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Actually, uh, I'm the consultant. Got milk? Ha ha. Alright, let's see what we're working with.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: I'll get that for you.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, thank you. Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing. I don't know if she's getting anything.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Okay. Let me feel here.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Yeah, it's quite full. Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C. Uh, does that hurt?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, I mean, it feels... pressure.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Are you sure it doesn't hurt?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No. It just feels like pressure.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Okay, well. Feel how I'm flicking the nipple? Like that?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yup.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Stimulate it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Perfect.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: And you can just... The baby should grab on to that.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I think she will.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay. So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though. I'm not sure if...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: We'll figure it out.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: It doesn't... Why don't you bring your baby over here... She's beautiful.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay. Aw, thank you.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Yes, congratulations.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Thank you.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Well, you're doing a good job. Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you. Okay?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Please do.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, sh**t.<br>

    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No need. I saw him do it. I can try it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.<br>

    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: You said she liked me.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin. And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I've dumped better than Erin.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Lynn was as hot as Erin.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: This isn't about me, and that is debatable. And I have a personality, where as you... Yes, Andy?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant] Ow.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Kev... Nice. Going.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Well...<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Isabelle</strong>: Knock knock.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, hey, Isabelle.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Isabelle</strong>: Hey. Pam, she's gorgeous. Can I hold her?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yes. She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down. Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her. I don't want her to spit up on you. Come here, sweety... Oh, my God! Wrong baby!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: What?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Wrong baby! This is not our baby! Sshh.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay, okay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, my gosh.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kathy</strong>: [waking up] Oh,has she been fussing long?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, not at all.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Perfect.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kathy</strong>: I was out like a light... Oh, she's not hungry...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: How's it going?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Ha ha ha.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Bottles are fine. A lot of babies grow up using bottles. So are you excited to bring your baby home?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: We definitely are. At 3:00, right? You said we could stay until 3:00?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Yeah, you can. It's 2:35.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Half hour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Twenty five minutes. And you're all set with the car seat?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yes, car seat's right there.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: That bottom part needs to go in the car.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Ha ha, be back in twenty five minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be... Can we get a late checkout? I don't... I don't think she heard me.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Isabelle</strong>: [entering the Halpert house] Hello? Dwight? What, what are you doing here?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Isabelle. Hello... Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Isabelle</strong>: Wow, ha. New cabinets.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yup.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Isabelle</strong>: All I did was bring macaroni and cheese... Where's the fridge?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh, it's... In the backyard. I'll take this.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Isabelle</strong>: Oh... Well, I'll let you get back to it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Hey, listen. I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning. You know, just for fun.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Isabelle</strong>: Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Are they now? Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right? Ha ha.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Isabelle</strong>: Yeah...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Alright. I'll call you, kid.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Isabelle</strong>: Do that.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Are you really sure we should be leaving?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Hospital employee</strong>: Yeah.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: But you hear the baby crying, right?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Hospital employee</strong>: Mm-hmm... Where's your car?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Uh, it's in the lot.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Hospital employee</strong>: Oh, a lot of fathers bring their car around.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Right, okay. Yes, that would be the smart thing to do. Uh, Pam, I will be right back.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, please hurry.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately. It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Okay, good.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: The fax says "Erin, will you have dinner with me?" from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: It's busy. Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Sorry, that's unacceptable. I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: [tearing up] You can't talk to me like that. I didn't do anything wrong. I've been having a tough day today.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Oh, God, no. I'm... Just read the fax.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: You read the fax.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I'm... I'm asking you out.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Oh, my God. That's amazing. Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: So, it's a date.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Yes. Do you have a day in mind?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yeah, what day? What day?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Everyday is fine. Or...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Well, that, what's that one?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Thursday?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Okay. Let's do it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Okay.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Hospital employee</strong>: Would you like me to help you up out of the chair?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, yeah, sorry.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Hospital employee</strong>: Yeah, we just got a lot of discharges today.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, alright, thanks... Okay, do you want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay... Okay, let me... Just you and me. Come on. There we go... Yeah... Oh, yeah. Like that. There we go. You got it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Five tickets on the windshield... Hey.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hi. We did it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You used my move, didn't you?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I used a variation of your move.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [smoking a cigar] There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love. And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today... I think I'm going to be sick...<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Two forms of ID, please.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: And now you, two forms of ID, please... Alright, all is in order. I just need your signature... What is it?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Nothing.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Alright. How would you like to celebrate?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice. I feel sick... [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby] I couldn't find the iPod... Give me a couple days. I'll be out of your hair.</div>`,

And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk] Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!<br>

    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: We have a crisis. Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock. Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing... unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like. I've never been a fan.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: F and C, doubletime?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go. Any other questions?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: One more. Why are you talking like that?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: To save time, Jim.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah, she has a good point. I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh! Forget it. Where is Creed?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: Here.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Creed. Quality assurance. Your job. I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed. Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill. And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Jim, big fire in your house. Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper. Went home to all the kids.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah, I gotta call out on that.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, no, no, no. Not good enough. This is a keystone account. I want you in the school. In person.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: All right.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I want you to bring a partner.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: I'll go.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, sweet cheeks. We need someone who's actually made a sale. Andy, you go.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [English accent] William Dolittle at your service. A.K.A., Will Do.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, no. I need two men on this. That's what she said. No time! But she did. NO TIME! Guys, get on this. Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yes! You are entering the "No Spin Zone!"<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: We're having a press conference?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, Pam. The press is just gonna find out by themselves.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Not! [scoffs]<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Here's the thing. When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference. Alert the media, and then you control the story. Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you. That's what happened to O.J.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology. The press wants a story, I will give them a story.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, did the press ask for a story?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: <em class="text-italics">Here</em> is your headline. "Scranton Area Paper Company, Dunder Mifflin, apologizes to valued client. Some companies still know how business is done." Okay? Battle stations everybody, let's go, go, go, go, go, go!<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: Yes, hello. Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton. I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there. And I'm trying to remember who it was. Mm-hmm. Who wasn't there last week? Debbie Brown. And which day was that? Wednesday, the eleventh. Perfect.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job. I will do whatever it takes to survive. Like I did... when I was a homeless man.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people. But guess what? From now on, you guys are no longer losers! So give yourselves a round of applause. [Kelly and Kevin clap]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: I know, right? Probably a lot.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: OK, Angela. I love your enthusiasm. All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say "Customer Service, this is Kelly!" Except don't say "Kelly," say your own name. Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name. Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation!
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: [in accent] Absolutely!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: [in accent] 'ello, mate!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: [in accent] I like ice cream! I need a boyfriend.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: [in accent] I like ice cream too, mate. Alligators and dingo babies.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Beer me!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: What's that?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Hand me that water. I always say "Beer me." Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time. So how's what's-her-name?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You know her name.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Who, Karen? Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends. [takes swig of water] Mmm. How's the apartment hangin'?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: It's fine.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Nice. Check out this sunshine, man. Global warming, right? Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: What about music? Do you have any music?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Uh, yeah. Should have said so. [sings] Rha-dah-dah-dah! Give me the b*at, boys, and free my soul. I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay. Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the b*at, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Your call, dude. My girlfriend made an awesome mix. Beer me that disc.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Lord, beer me strength.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: So, Tuna. When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Did that <em class="text-italics">really</em> need to be said?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Well not everything a guy says needs to be said. Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Whoa! What the--- Why is my girlfriend here?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, is she that teacher in the white?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Which one... is she?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: The one in the green hoodie.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wow.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something?<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Chad Lite</strong>: Hi, uh---<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: And you must be uh, from the Washington Post.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Chad Lite</strong>: Scranton Times. Chad Lite, "Lighter Side of Life."<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: And "Breaking Corporate News."<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Chad Lite</strong>: And obits.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh, dear God. OK, here are your credentials. You've been granted level three security clearance.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Chad Lite</strong>: Oh...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Don't get too excited, that's out of 20. Right this way. Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly. Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Chad Lite</strong>: Uh, yeah, I'd like uh, uh---<br>

    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jamie</strong>: Oh... yeah...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You never told me you were in high-school!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jamie</strong>: This is weird. I... gotta go to Spanish.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh my God.<br>

    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: [on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point. I'm sorry. No, I am <em class="text-italics">so</em> sorry.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: [on phone] Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale.
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [on phone] Excuse me? Well, I don't see how that's our fault. And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. [hangs up]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing <em class="text-italics">sooo</em> good. Look, you have so many good qualities, that the one that you might wanna work on is, apologizing?<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Emergency dentist appointment.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu. I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there. We would have caught this.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call. I'm so sorry. Bye.<br>

    <strong class="text-strong">Barbara</strong>: Hello, I'm looking for Michael Scott.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client. Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: So, let us consider this matter ended.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Barbara</strong>: Well it isn't ended. I'm... I'm very angry. I--- I could have lost business.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I know, I know you're angry. And we are truly, truly sorry.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Barbara</strong>: I don't accept your apology. The watermark was obscene and horrifying.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well, we are extremely sorry.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Barbara</strong>: I don't accept.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">School Official</strong>: I'll be with you in a moment.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: All right.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Who was that guy she was talking to? At her locker.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Not important. Because you're not dating her. Because it's a felony.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: But who <em class="text-italics">was</em> that guy?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: <em class="text-italics">Probably</em> another high-school student.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">School Official</strong>: The issue with the watermark is very serious.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Absolutely.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">School Official</strong>: We teach our students that character counts.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: And you should.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">School Official</strong>: But---<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [scoffs] Pfft. You don't teach it well enough. One of your students is a <em class="text-italics">bitch</em>.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Andy... is having a <em class="text-italics">real</em> rough day today.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook. A full page, two words---<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: "Good luck."<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: That's not what I had in mind.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Ask where he's from.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [on phone] Where are you from? Ohio? That's nice. So what do you want? [to Kelly] He's upset about the watermark.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: OK, great. Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry.
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [on phone] It was an unfortunate error. <em class="text-italics">We're fixing it.</em> And you already got your money back...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: And you're sorry.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: ...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something!<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Barbara</strong>: Well, it--- it doesn't help, because it already happened to me.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: The watermark... it's a one time thing.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Barbara</strong>: I don't care! It was disgusting. Cartoon characters having sex?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual? Both animals were smiling.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK...<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I grew up on a farm. I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable. Goat on chicken. Chicken on goat. Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching. Whoever drew this got it exactly right.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What... can I do, for you?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Barbara</strong>: I, for starters, I think that you should resign.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well... [exhales] OK, well... Um, wasn't really my fault. The guys at the papermill---<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Barbara</strong>: You're the head---<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: The guys at the papermill--- No no no!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Barbara</strong>: You're the head of the company!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: <em class="text-italics">I'm</em> the head of the company?!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Barbara</strong>: Yes, and that makes it your responsibility---<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, I'm a regional manager---<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Barbara</strong>: And so you should lose your job!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No--- my--- OK, this is insane. You can get out of here. Get out!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Barbara</strong>: Fine.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That's insane. We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Barbara</strong>: Mm-hmm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It's non-transferable...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Doesn't matter. Out please!<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Barbara</strong>: I'm calling the Better Business Bureau.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! [to Chad Lite] Did you get all that?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Chad Lite</strong>: Everything.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: We gotta do something. [exhales] This is spinning out of control, Pam. This is just, not...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: It's just the Scranton Times...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, then Newsweek picks it up. And then CNN does a story about it. Then... YouTube gets a hold of it...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You know what? I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You're right. It will blow over. But it's not... going to take... a week or two. [pulls out a video camcorder from his desk] Do you know what this is for?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yes.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. He says he needs a woman's touch.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [Dwight is spraying far too much hairspray into Michael's hair] OK, I think that's good.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: "Hello. I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner. Let me tell you something. Something from the heart. I am not leaving this office. It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that."<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That's how devoted I am to this job.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I'm just saying...<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I know.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: They would flank you. Throw in a concussion grenade.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I understand that, Dwight.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight? And now we're wasting tape. I'm gonna have to cut this all out. Can you say cut?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Cut.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: So I'll know where---<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Cut.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'm asking Pam to do it, please.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Cut.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK, ready?<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Kevin, what's four plus seven?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: [thinks] Eleven.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations. Oooh, yes. Facial.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: [laughs] Yes. [air high five]<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: You two are apes.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I'm sorry... that you're both morons.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Oh, but you still said "I'm sorry."<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I called you morons.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Still said it.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Five, four, three. "There is no way, I will resign. It wouldn't be fair. Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me. Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway. If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasn't me. They're trying to make me an escape goat. If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it. The F-word. You have one day."<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: One day for what?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That's... they always give an ultimatum.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: OK.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Good, cut?<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Cut. That was your best apology video ever.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Thought so too.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: [to Dwight] Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown. I thought maybe you'd like to sign it. Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her. She's got some children.<br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: I feel terrible about Debbie Brown. She got fired because of Dwight. So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times. Why do bad things always happen to the good people? It's tragic. Just tragic.<br>

    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Karen</strong>: Hey, Dwight, lookin' sharp.<br>
    <br>
    <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert. Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?<br>

  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: So... you're going to provide them, then?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: What the hell?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Come on. You've got to be kidding me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Decent people everywhere will get offended.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: That's nice.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Really, Pam...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time. [hugs Angela]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Ow! He pinched me!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: We'll see.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Thank you, Dwight.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Good-bye.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: See you later. [others say good-bye]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara. [laughter]
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No... I didn't steal your joke.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes. I said that yesterday.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: But you can say that about anything.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Dwight...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Oh yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It's easy. That's what I'm saying.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: This is what I'm talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Pam and Jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Get out of here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, my God, Dwight.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: There's... a name.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Micheal</strong>: Ok.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Is that all you have on her?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You're an idiot.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. [Angela beeps her car horn.] It's the hair-- [beeps again.] Ok. Ok. I'm going. [long beep] God.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [in Andy's car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to? It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Mmm-hmm. Erin?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [in car] Hey, my aunt told me something neat.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, wow. That's cool.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Lousy Picture.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [in car, Michael driving] Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: What? No way!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Those glasses are super dark.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh. God.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Alright. We need some tunes, I think.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You know what? I made you a cd...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You did?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Mmm-hmm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That was nice of you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You're gonna like this. [Dwight's voice on the cd] "Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--" [Michael turns off cd]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yeah. It's practical.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No. No. That's not how it works.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Front Desk Clerk</strong>: Halpert...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Front Desk Clerk</strong>: Great.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I know. We're pretty excited, too.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Can we take a look at the suite now?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Front Desk Clerk</strong>: Oh, I'm sorry. Somebody just checked in.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Front Desk Clerk</strong>: Oh, no. Just an individual. That man over there.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed. [laughs]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I don't like that.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I'm gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hello. Reservation for Michael Scott.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Front Desk Clerk</strong>: One moment while I check.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Mmm-hmm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Front Desk Clerk</strong>: I'm sorry, sir, but I'm not seeing you in here. When did you make your reservation?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I don't have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Front Desk Clerk</strong>: Oh, ok. Unfortunately, sir, the block only applies to the rate. I'm afraid we're all sold out.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number: Romeo. Tango. G7745.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Front Desk Clerk</strong>: Yes. Schrute.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Front Desk Clerk</strong>: Sure. No problem.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Ok.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Front Desk Clerk</strong>: Here's your key, Mr. Schrute.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No way. What if I meet someone?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'm staying in your-- Come on, Dwight.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No. No.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I would do the same for you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You would?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Really?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes... just go--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh. Thank God.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Please?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she's going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Mmm-hmm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ok.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! [rips reservation out of Michael's hand] That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I don't have a room?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No you do not.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.'<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It worked.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Jerk.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: When Mary was denied a room at the inn... Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we don't know what happens because that story hasn't been told yet.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Hudson.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Not in the same bed. In the other bed.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: I got one queen size bed.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You... are... kidding me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'm not a physics major, Stanley. I'm just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Oh. Gross.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Blow my brains out.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That's rude.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Mr. Halpert</strong>: So, which one is Pam's grandma?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mr. Halpert</strong>: No.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mr. Halpert</strong>: Oh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: How ya doin'?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mr. Halpert</strong>: Hi.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Nice to meet you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mr. Halpert</strong>: Nice to meet you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [talking quietly, trying not to move his lips]That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Pretty sure everyone heard that.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Didn't move my lips.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hey, Mema.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mema</strong>: I wasn't sure about your branch of the family. After I heard about your parent's divorce. But you and Jim are just perfect. God bless you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh. Thank you... but nobody's perfect.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mema</strong>: Well... I wouldn't care to live if I thought that.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Mr. Beesly. How are ya?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mr. Beesly</strong>: I'd like you to meet Christy Kelly.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mr. Beesly</strong>: [laughs] No no. She's my girlfriend. Hey? Can you make room at the head table?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Little Girl</strong>: Why would they make the bad man a boss if you're so much smarter?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kids</strong>: Ewwww!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.<br>

  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Penny</strong>: I'm sorry, it's Kevin. I thought it was Gil?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: She thought I was your boyfriend.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oscar, it was an honest mistake.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Him? Him?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Oscar, I would be proud to date you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Penny</strong>: I'm sorry.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I'm not gay. I'm Kevin.<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Um... also--<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: How did Meredith get put at the young people's table?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: What? You're kid-- That's-- You're--<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabel</strong>: Jim and Pam, I can't tell you how happy I am to be here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Head table, where I belong.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It's just for family.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well, who's that one?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. [laughs] In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: That's a very good record.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pete</strong>: Alright, so I'll be like, 'You're so sweet guys and so kind'.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Tom</strong>: That's when I'll do the face, like-<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pete</strong>: Like, 'What? What?'. And then we'll just give him a little punch in the back and--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Tom</strong>: A noogie?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pete</strong>: You know what? Never too married for a noogie.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would k*ll with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Tom</strong>: Pam, you've got the greatest smile and you're body is really fine.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pete</strong>: Smoking.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Tom</strong>: Hoping it'll make our wives take it up a notch.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pete</strong>: A little mo' cardio.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That's not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn't gonna make a toast and I'm not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Knight Rider.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. [no one is laughing]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Very smart.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah. Go ahead.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pete</strong>: Douche.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Like... a year.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So... I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mema</strong>: What's obvious? Why can't Pam drink?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [clears throat] Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mema</strong>: They were living together?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, my God. Please.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: ...but it's different for the-- ok. Ok.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Michael. Stop.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Jim.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: To waiting.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Everyone</strong>: [quiet and scattered] To waiting.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Mema</strong>: I should have known. The hotels television set had a movie on called "Bruno" last night. The remote control had so darn many buttons on it, I couldn't turn it off. So I had to just sit there while it happened to me. I wondered, 'How could they pick such a hotel?' Hmmm. Now I know.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Mema.<br>

  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I can't believe it was me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I know. I can't believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I have not found that to be the case.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hey, smooth guys.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I'm so sorry.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, my God. Are you serious?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: There's gonna be a free room?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hi, Mema. It's Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mema</strong>: Oh. You're that foul guy that kept talking about intercourse.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she's better than everybody.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Mema</strong>: I want to go to bed but I can't. I can't turn that television off.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there. [turns off tv]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mema</strong>: Oh. Thank you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You're welcome.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mema</strong>: It was that horrible Charlie Rose.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mema</strong>: People are like cats and dogs these days.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Exactly.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mema</strong>: This used to be such a great country.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I know.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mema</strong>: I don't know what happened to it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: They're gonna name the baby after you, you know. They're gonna call it Mema.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Mema</strong>: You mean, Sylvia.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes, and if it's a boy they will call it Sylvio.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Partay. Room 639.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yes!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: That sounds epic. Can we bring anything?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: And where do you think you're going?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [sighs] Nevermind.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Are you sure?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: It'll be fun.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What are you wearing?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: What? It's a casual, social outfit.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ok. [Dwight howls] That's not appropriate. [Dwight continues howling] Uncool. Uncool, Dwight. [they both howl] Ok. Ok. Come on. Let's go. [both howl as they exit]<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: It's a good idea.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabel</strong>: Wait. You're worried about your horses? That's cool. How many horses do you have?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Nine and three-quarters.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without k*ll the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [talking to an attractive woman] Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Drop this one. Abort.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Why?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I found twins.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Aren't they magnificent?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: They're men, Dwight.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I love finding a good set of twins.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Something is wrong with you.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: [everyone is dancing] Go Meredith. Nice moves.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Lame! What else you got, Andy?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: How about a little bit of this.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Oh yeah. What else you got?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: What else you got?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo! [Andy does a split and screams out in pain]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: What else you got?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. [knocks on Pam's door] Pam? [knocks again]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Everyone else is too drunk. Just don't let me die here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [on the phone] Hey, hey! Where are you? Can you take Andy to the hospital?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [over phone] What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: He tore his scrotum dancing.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [over phone] What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: He is in my room icing his balls.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [over phone] What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Please stop saying what. Can you take him?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Your brothers took you out drinking?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Uh...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [over phone] Is that Pam? Hey, have her come out! Have her come out! It would be like Coyote Ugly.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: That's Michael. You're out with Michael?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [over phone] And Dwight.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [over phone] Hey-O!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Pam, it just happened.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, fine. I'll take him.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I love you. Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [over phone] I love you! [laughs]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Are you pushing me off the phone?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No. Let's talk for a long time.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Goodbye. [hangs up phone]<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Mmm! It's after midnight. [points at Jim]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael and Dwight</strong>: You're married. [hugs Jim] He's married!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Congratulations.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: That's not how that works.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh my goodness.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh my God. You're not going to be able to talk back.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You'll have Pam to answer to.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: She'll be sitting home saying, "Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons." [Dwight laughs] "And... and clip my toenails."<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: "Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair. I want to watch TV."<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Now you sound like Kermit.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Are you sure this is the right way?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Nope. I, like you, have never been here before.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Look, I'm not the one who asked you to do a split when you've never done one before.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I was trying to liven things up a little bit. I was kinda doing your job so--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: My job? My job is to get married in the morning. That's my job.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [Pam swerves the car back and forth] Ow, ow!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [snickers] I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding. Ah yeah. She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No. No that was real.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [folding his pants on top of the ice machine, man walks in with ice bucket] Why don't you take a picture. It'll last longer. God. Can't I get a little privacy?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Hotel Employee</strong>: [Kevin rings bell at the front desk] Good morning. How can I help you?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hotel Employee</strong>: You must be Mr. Malone. One moment please.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Thank you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hotel Employee</strong>: [whispers to manager] Sir. It's the man with the shoes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hotel Manager</strong>: Mr. Malone. Your shoes are gone.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: They were stolen?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hotel Manager</strong>: No. Destroyed.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hotel Manager</strong>: The bag was opened by our shoe shine and the smell overcame him. I too smelled them and made the choice that they must be thrown away. Incinerated actually.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: But that was my only pair of shoes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hotel Manager</strong>: It became a safety issue, sir.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Well... well damn-it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hotel Employee</strong>: I can offer you a complimentary breakfast.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Okay.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [walking out of hotel room with a woman] You have everything?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabel</strong>: Hmm-hmm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Cell phone? Charger?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabel</strong>: Yeah. So you sure you don't want breakfast? It's the most important meal of the day.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It really is. I'm not hungry. I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep. And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding. She needs you Isabel.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabel</strong>: That's really sweet, Dwight. So I'll see you at the wedding?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You know it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabel</strong>: K. [they kiss]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Okay, get out of here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabel</strong>: Bye.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [passes Isabel] Hey, good morning. [to Dwight] It's about damn time. I haven't gone to the bathroom in a day and a half. [walks into hotel room] Oh my God, Dwight. This room is a pit.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [lays on bed] Really? I hadn't noticed. Too busy knocking boots.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [watching Dwight eat breakfast] How can you eat like that?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I'm ravenous after a night of love making. You?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Hey, what was she like?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: She was cute. You know? She was hot. She was very hot. She made love like a tiger.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Brides side or grooms side? Or townie?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: She was from Europe.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No kidding.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Uh-huh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I bet she had hairy armpits.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Wait a second. You're not into her? Are you kidding me?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: She's Pam's best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh please. Put a g*n in my mouth.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No... you're crazy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Look. She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one. She's a bumpkin. Pass.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: She's-- okay. Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist? You have to take x-rays. You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth. You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in. It-- it--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You should ask her out.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [stands up and walks away] I already have my European girlfriend.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: If your hat hits me in the face one more time--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: That's funny. Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley's date]<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [sees Kevin's toupee] Oh my God.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Oh...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Oscar. Angela.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Are you in a lot of pain?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Oh cause of last night? No way. Reports have been exaggerated. Weddings make me very emotional. I um--I just have that side to me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: People say you cry all the time.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Well that's not--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Crotch injuries are the worst. You don't need to tell me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I wasn't telling you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Is there still something there?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Excuse me?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: It didn't get torn off?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: No, it didn't--nothing got torn off. Who told you that?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I may have told some people that. I'm nervous. I'm about to get married.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: If you want to sit on this-- [hands Andy her wrap] I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis. Make it softer.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: It was my scrotum. Um, and it was. Thank you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, here we go. They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need? I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special. I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory. [holds up painting] And I have another one of them in the nude. But that one is for me.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Penny</strong>: Is it zipping over your belly? Don't squish the baby.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Thank you weirdo.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam's mom</strong>: everybody see Kristie's stupid blonde extensions? It's like they were made from a plastic broom.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, here I come. [walks out in her wedding dress]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam's mom</strong>: Oh darling! You look beautiful.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Thanks mom.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam's mom</strong>: Oh, I hope he deserves you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: He does.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam's mom</strong>: Are you sure? Remember you don't have to do this. You don't.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Penny</strong>: Mom, you're totally projecting. You're being a drag.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yes. Thank you, mom.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabel</strong>: Hey, I'm going to go outside and talk to Dwight.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay great. [Isabel kisses her cheek] Yeah, I'll see you in a second. [pauses] Wait, what? [tries to follow, but veil gets caught on wall and tears] Oh! Oh no!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [answers cell phone] Hey!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Can you come here please?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Is this allowed?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No. No, but I'm allowing it. Just come here.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [talking to a woman] That was an intelligent comment.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabel</strong>: Hello stranger. How do I look?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh. Fine. Isabel, [holds out hand] nice to see you. What do you want?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabel</strong>: Um... [shakes head] nothing. Anymore.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [turns back to other woman] So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [to Isabel] Hey, hey... He's not sitting with me either. Where are you sitting? You need a seat buddy?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabel</strong>: I'm standing. I'm a bridesmaid.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid. Where am I gonna go?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hey.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wow. You look--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Terrible.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: So beautiful. [Pam's starts to cry. Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: My veil tore. I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [takes her hand] Hey. You look just as I imagined you would. Pam, you're so pretty.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [sighs] Thank you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: And who cares? It's a stupid veil, right?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and-- [Jim cuts off half his tie]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: There. Now we're even. [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [sighs] Everyone's driving me crazy. I know way too much about Andy's scrotum. [Jim chuckles] And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend. [sighs] This is supposed to be our wedding day. Why did we invite all these people?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down she wouldn't be a good wife.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Yes.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: [to Kevin who is bouncing up and down] What are you doing?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: How long do you take to pee?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: The peeing is fast, Oscar. It's getting my tie back on.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [to Pam's mom] Hey. Hi. Do you--would you have a snack in your purse? You're a mom. I just figured you might have--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam's mom</strong>: Oh, yeah--[hands Michael a snack]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh! Eww... apricot. Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam's mom</strong>: No.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh... okay. Were you saving it?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam's mom</strong>: Oh, no, no, no. That's okay. I was just--I've had a very rough weekend.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'm sorry. [puts food in his mouth] Ugh. Apricot. Made of real apes.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Do you think they canceled the wedding?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Relax. You'll get your sh*t at Jim. Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: my weekend was bad so far.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam's mom</strong>: Oh--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I came here hoping to meet somebody. You know, as you do at weddings. End up going to sleep by the vending machine. It was loud, but it was warm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam's mom</strong>: Oh that sounds awful.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam's mom</strong>: Oh--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: It is a terrible year for love.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam's mom</strong>: Yeah. Guess it is.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'm thinking about having my sperm frozen.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Tom Halpert</strong>: Excuse me, are you Michael Scott?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michel</strong>: Um, yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Tom</strong>: Heard you might have a whoopee cushion on you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pete Halpert</strong>: Sisters in the can and we totally want to get her when she comes back.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, wow. That sounds hilarious. I do actually. [pulls whoopee cushion out of pocket and hands it to them] There you go. Use it in good health.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Tom and Pete</strong>: [laughing] Yes!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. What is the etiquette on taking the gifts? Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: No.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Who would want it?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Toby.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: [sighs]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [looks over and sees hole in his present] Crap. [sees turtle on the ground, goes over and picks it up] Come here you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Well I guess this weddings not going to happen. I wonder if this is it for them. [Jim and Pam walk in laughing]<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam's dad</strong>: Hey. What happened?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Where were you guys? Do you know how long I've been waiting here?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Well we are here now, so let's just--<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [walks up] Yes! Yes! I have so much joy... in my heart... right now. How do I look?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You look great.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You look great.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Tom</strong>: [looks at Jim's cut tie] Wear a tie much?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Penny</strong>: [music starts playing and people start dancing down the isle] I begged them not to.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Mm-hmm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Penny</strong>: I know you specifically put this song on your Do Not Play list.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yes I did.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Penny</strong>: I'm sorry.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [smiles] Go ahead. I think it's your turn.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Penny</strong>: Wait, what happened? You're okay with this?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah, I'm okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Penny</strong>: Okay then! [takes flower girl to dance down the isle]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Saw it.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video. I knew we'd need a back-up plan. The boat was actually Plan C. The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago. Pretty much the day I met her.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: What an awesome party. The best wedding I've ever been too. I got six numbers. One more would have been a complete telephone number. This was epic. My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking. [sticks his feet into the hotel ice machine] Whoo. My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold. What a lovely hotel.</div>`,

Yeah, I'm pregnant... Great, well, I'll write up the order. Okay, thanks.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Wait a minute! You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby? Oh, thank you very much. I'm excited. Oh, definitely.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No, no! You need to come by your sales honorably!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life. People like it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [on the phone with a client] Hey there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ... Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly. Okay.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I need a baby. I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one. Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life. Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Kevin, you're such a gourmand.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook. Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hmm.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot. Not all meals. Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner. One last ultra feast.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Mmmm, that sounds great. What are you thinking?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I think it should be a surprise.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: [After Pam has a contraction] Oh, getting there, huh?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, no. I still have time.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart. So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it. And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I cannot wait for that joke to be over.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Ooh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Michael, you shouldn't have done that.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You know the baby's not going to live here, right?
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here. Burning man, port-o-potty.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital!
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital. We are waiting until midnight.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Ooh, spooky. But why?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Because the insurance company only covers two nights.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Everything's fine. We have plenty of time.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nick</strong>: Well, you don't want to wait too long, Pam. Otherwise the baby's going to become a teenager in there and you'll be up all night, from the rock music.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say. Weird I.T. nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [as Nick looks over at her] What are you looking at?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Ha, nerd.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Did you know that labor can last weeks? Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [with Angela in the break room] Bare my child.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Excuse me?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother. If you agree, say nothing. If you disagree, say anything... Very well. Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [after Pam has another contraction] That's seven minutes. Here we go. This is happening. Come on.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hold on, hold on. It isn't midnight yet.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Are you serious? Pam.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I... Pam, please.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yeah, no, you really should. Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks. My old roommate.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Did you hear that? Butt-mud Brooks.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Five minutes apart.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: So, the plan was seven minutes. But we're calling an audible, because that's her call. Because she's the quarterback. I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, stop watching me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay, crazy. I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Mm-hmm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal. While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Not until midnight.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Guys. Word of advice. Speaking as a former baby. Don't get too hung up on baby names. I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him. I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You know, it's getting real crowded in here. Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [as Andy and Kevin shout "yeah!" in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Actually, the distractions are good. I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Distractions are good! That means conference room, five minutes! No, no, five seconds! Right now, right now! Conference room! Topic, potpourri! Let's go!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Um, I am sort of a master of distraction. When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class. Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. [Michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises.]<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Can we do sleight of hand tricks?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I will allow that.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yes! Can anyone do those?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: I'm going to go look at the Internet.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [as Pam has another contraction] Oh! Oh, alright. That's a good one.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys. Just, um, keep talking.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, thanks, Kelly.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Does anybody have anything? Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes, Phyl?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [ as Pam shakes her head] Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I can do the evolution of dance-dance.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [as Pam gives the thumbs up] That sounds good! Do you need some music, or...? Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Nope, actually music would just throw me off. I need complete silence. Okay... [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances] You're clapping. I need complete silence. Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over. Evolution of dance-dance.

  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Good afternoon.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Have a seat.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: What is this?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Of course.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: You know I was thinking...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Now, then. Let's get to it, shall we? Item one[/b]: [speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus. Agreed?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Agreed.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [as Pam has another contraction] Where are we? We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay, you know what? I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call. He'd probably know...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Jim, please. Happy thoughts here. Happy times.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor. And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor. Erin, read the first one.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Um, stimulate the nipples.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples. Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Her shirt is touching them. Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: I have a shirt like that in my car.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Okay, uh, the second one is walk around. We're already doing the opposite of that. Perfect. Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, the opposite of that?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Stick spicy food up her butt.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Nope, nope, nope, nope. Come on, let's go to the hospital. Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Mm-hmm. Okay, great. Well, sorry.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Why don't you go do some work?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Great. I will do that. Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled. And you know how very rarely I use that word. Frazzled.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I know, you don't like to be frazzled.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, I don't.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now. Totally.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ooh, someone's freakin'.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: A little frazzled.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I think he is.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy, she's crazy. I'm not crazy, she's crazy. [reading from various books] Five to seven minutes. Five to seven minutes. Six minutes. Different, but not really. Five to seven minutes.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Warf.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: No Star Trek names.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Okay. Fine.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: What if it's a girl?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Irrelevant question. Section 5A, child shall be male.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Hey. Uh-uh. I cannot control that. You can't put that in here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yes you can.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: No.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Absolutely not.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [Pam approaches as he sits in his car] Hey.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hey. I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Ah, you know me too well.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, Jim.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah? ... Oh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Everything is fine. You don't have to worry. Try not to think about it. She's not coming out for a while, okay?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Did you say "she?"<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I called the doctor like a week ago. I couldn't wait... Oh, God, don't be mad.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Mad? How could I be mad? We're having a little girl.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Mm-hmm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wow, we're having a little girl. Oh, man.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I know.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Woo, alright. Well, I definitely feel better.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Good.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright... Hey, did you change?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, yeah, my water broke.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh. Oh...<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [enters the office and has another contraction] Oh, whoa. Ha. Wow.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Pam, Pam! Okay, alright, okay, it's time. Time to go to the hospital. Somebody get Jim, please! Is it midnight yet?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: No, it's 4:35.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: 4:35. Alright, almost made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn't have sex like seven and a half hours later. But you had to have the afternoon delight. I understand. Sometimes you have to go for it. Let's go to the hospital, shall we?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, not yet, Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: We can do...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast! Where's Kevin?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh. What? You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: That's fancy feast. Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What is October feast?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: There is no rush to get to the hospital. I am fine. I'll get there. And if I don't get there, I don't get there.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Our ultra feast menu's theme[/b]: Hollywood. We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels. I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I... Are you okay?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm fine. Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright. Time to go. Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That's right, let's do this.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Let's give it a sh*t.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Nope. No, no, that's better. That wasn't even the worst of them. I'm fine.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey, come on. Let's go to the hospital.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: They're not that bad still, babe.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Pam, Pam, it's time. Let's go to the hospital.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, it's passing, it's fine. It's okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Come on, Michael says we should go now.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Let's go, Pam. Yeah, I think we should head out.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, it's passing, it's fine.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Pam.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Ah, no, it passed. It's good.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You know what? Let's go. We got to go to the hospital.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, I'm not going. I'm not... It's fine. [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on. No! I am not going! I am not going, okay!? I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey, are you kidding me?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Are you kidding?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: If anyone can do this, you can do this.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You can do this. You can do this.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Pam, I'm scared. I'm real scared.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'm scared, too.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I'm petrified.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: A really awesome baby.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: We're going to have a baby.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: So let's have it at the hospital.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Let's do that.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: How are we doing on contractions?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Two minutes apart.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Two minutes...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, God. Oh, no.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Michael, I told you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: It's okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Jim, we waited too long!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I know, I know, I know. It went by too soon.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: We waited too long! Two minutes doesn't do us any good. Well, what happened to four and three minutes?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: We're okay, Jim! Okay, Pamela. You know what time it is?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I don't want to have my baby here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You're not going to. You know where you're going?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: The hospital.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes, you are. And you know what you're going to have?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: A baby.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes! We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I got it! I got it! Everybody it's go time! At your stations. Stanley, man the phones. Meredith, please, get bottled water. Erin, call an ambulance, please!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call an ambulance, I call the cops.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check! Got it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright, I have my wallet.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Go bag's in the car... Keys, my keys, where's my keys?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Go bag! Where's my go bag? Where's my go bag?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: There's nothing in it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You are telling me now that there is nothing in it. Okay, great! Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Has anyone checked how dilated she is? This is ridiculous!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Dwight, get away!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, no, no. Dwight, let Jim do that, please.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I didn't know we had a tape measure.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] "We" don't.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay, I can't find my keys! I cannot find my keys! Found 'em. They're here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight, Jim and Michael</strong>: Here we go!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Good luck!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nick</strong>: Good luck, Pam!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Thank you! Wish me luck!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: Have fun! [sigh]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Hey, it's 5:00!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [entering the elevator] Here we go! Here we go! On our way!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: Hold it!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Come on, Stanley! Okay. We're going now!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Oh, one more!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, no, no, no! Out, out! Idiot.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Dwight, what is the traffic like?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Doesn't matter. I'll escort you!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Alright.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Let's go!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Geesh, Dwight!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [as he peels out of the parking lot and stops] Michael!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What!?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: This is where I saw that deer last week.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Where?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Right over by that fence.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: By the bushes?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay, Michael! Focus!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, go, go, go, go!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Let's go!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. I got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright, here we go! You're doing great! She'll be here soon.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, just breathe... She? You found out? Come on, guys. I wanted to be surprised.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Michael!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Stop texting, put your phone away! Come on.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Michael, come on!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'm texting about you, okay!?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Ugh, alright. [as he puts a police siren on top of his car] Let's move! ... What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Policeman</strong>: Pull over!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Are you kidding me?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Policeman</strong>: Pull over! [Dwight begins throwing various w*apon out of the window] You're not allowed to impersonate a police officer! Don't make this difficult, Dwight!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Wait, wait. My iPod's not in here!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: It has the birth song on it!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay. I know, I know. But my iPod is in the go bag. We'll be fine.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay, so what do you want to do?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I don't know! Let's go by the house and get it. It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Pam, no! Are you nuts? We're going to the hospital now.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Guys, guys! Stop fighting, come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go. [as he calls Dwight] Ready?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Dwight Schrute.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hello, Dwight. Pam left her iPod at her house. I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital. We need it yesterday.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday? I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Dwight! Go to my house. Get my iPod. I think it's on the kitchen table. Do not touch anything else. The key is under...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I don't need a key.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No, no, don't, don't tell me. Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Dwight just listen! It's underneath... [Dwight hangs up as the policeman hands him a ticket]<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wait, you alright?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Do you have everything, guys?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Michael, just go park the car.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, alright. [he parks in an ambulance zone]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hospital employee</strong>: Sir! You can't park here!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Dunder-Mifflin. It's okay. [he throws the keys into bushes across the street] I just did.<br>
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Pam's doing great. Uh, she's ten inches dilated now. Uh, sorry, meters. Centimeters. And she's also fully faced. Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet. It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Daddy? She's ready to push.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Where is my little nibblet? Halpert, room D1. Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you. Here we go.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [as Pam screams] Doing great, push again.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Doctor</strong>: Not yet.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, don't push. Pull. Pull.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Why don't you get more ice chips?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, Jim, stay!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Doctor</strong>: Okay. Really push this time, Pam.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [looking horrified as he walks from the room back into the lobby] Okay, not yet, not yet. I'm going to go wash my eyes.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That kid's going to have a lot of hair.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Hey, have you guys seen her?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: She hasn't popped yet.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: What? God damn it. She was supposed to come out yesterday.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born. This frame set me back fifty five bones. But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: This is ridiculous. We just can't wait here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I think it's going to be any minute now.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: But you don't know that. I mean, we could be here another half an hour.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: I have an ice cream cake in the car.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, my God. Go, go, go! Are you insane? Alright.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [Pam screams as he approaches the door to their room] Guys? Hello? Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: This is happening!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You're starting, you're kinda losing them.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, my God! Look at her! baby, she's so beautiful! Oh, my God.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, my God.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [smoking a cigar] Yeah, that's right. It's a baby, see?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Doctor</strong>: Sir! Sir, you can't smoke that in here. Put it, put it out.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay. You can't smoke anywhere these days.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [with Jim, holding the baby] She's incredible. Want to count her fingers and toes again?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No, let's let her rest. I'm sure there's still twelve on each.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Guys, guys!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Eleven pounds...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches. Mother and daughter are doing great.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Everyone</strong>: Yeah!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Thank you! Thank you!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Congratulations. That's great.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">(Pam's mom) Heleen</strong>: Hi there.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey, grandma's back.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Helene</strong>: Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Great.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, thank God. I haven't had caffeine in nine months.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Helene</strong>: Ooh, somebody has a full diaper.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh. Let me get it.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I am a diapering master. I have done little else in the past two months. There is nothing I cannot diaper. Go ahead. Try to think of something. I dare you.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Where's the baby? I want to see the baby. Oh! Oh, Helene, hi. Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this? Congratulations on being a grandma.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Helene</strong>: Hello, Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hello. Oh, good for you. I worry about you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Helene</strong>: I'm, uh... You know I think, uh, I think it's time for me to go.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Helene</strong>: Love you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Love you, as a friend.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Love you, mom.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ooh, I want to hold the baby!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Alright.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Again, no pants.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Ready?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod. I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it. What I did find, was mold, and lots of it. So, I did what anyone would do. Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it. I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets... Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: There she sat. Her name was Pam. She was a receptionist. She was engaged to an animal. There sat Jim. He was a gawky, tall salesman. The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able. I made a family! I got these two together, and I made a family.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: This man has a gift!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Who else here is single?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: I'm not single. I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I am offering up my services to you all. You saw what I did with Pam and Jim. I can help you, too.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any? [Stanley raises his hand] Who else? Come on! People, I know models!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ha ha, you got that right! Meredith? Come on, you're obviously single.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: You know it. I am never getting married.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Like Clooney.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Andrew, what about you?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Torn scrotum. Still on the mend, so not good timing.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin. I'm just waiting for the stars to align. Literally. I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well, when you least expect it, expect it. I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love. I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person. And, like Cupid, I am going to sh**t you with love.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: We were just kids. What did we know?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: How we doing?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Great.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Good.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Doesn't she sleep here?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: She can. But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest. You've been through a lot.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I think we'll be okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Okay, great.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [as the baby yawns] Oh, big yawn.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Ready? One, two, three...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: One, and then wrap around. It's okay. Hold that arm down.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I can't. She's too strong. She's, careful, though. You don't want to break it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: She's not gonna... Just...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I got it. Alright.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Go.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Nurse!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: How you doing?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I don't know. I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Really?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Doesn't feel right.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: How does one do that?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wasn't it... It's kinda like a... Like that.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Do you want to try it, Jim?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I think you're good. Doing a good job.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Somebody buzzed?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh! Really? Must have sat on it, Pam.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I can't tell if she's getting anything. It just doesn't really feel right.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while. I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Even if she's not getting anything?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Yeah, she'll be fine. I can always give her a bottle since we're in the nursery.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No. I read in the book about nipple confusion.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Oh, good. You know everything.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Well, I'll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Alright.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Alright.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: It's going to be alright.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Ha ha. No, yeah, that will be good.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: [in Michael's office] You wanted to see me?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Oh, boy! ... What's that sound?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: [as he appears from behind the door] Ta-da!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yes!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I don't know what to say.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Oh, say nothing. You will learn to love me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth. Why don't you guys get to know each other? Maybe have lunch together?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Erin, would you have lunch with me?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Good!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yes!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Michael, could I talk to you privately?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Sure. Kevin, please leave.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Bye.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Bye.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not. I like Andy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay. This is going to k*ll Kevin.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I'm sure he'll be fine.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'm not so sure. Kevin has an enormous heart. Literally, he has an elephant heart. He had a transplant when he was seventeen. Had some problems, blah blah blah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Really?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart. But he is very sensitive. And it won't k*ll Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him... I bet his heart is enlarged, though.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: I don't want anyone to die.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Just don't let him sit on you... I'm kidding. You'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good. There he is. Go to him.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Hi.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Hi.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: She touched my shoulder.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Hey, guys. We're short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, hi.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kathy</strong>: Hi.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dale</strong>: Hi, so sorry.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Careful... Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I know.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You see that? I'm pretty sure she's... Hi.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Did you grow up around here?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: No.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yes.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Why was I hiding behind the plant? Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class. Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class. And then, uh, they would say things like "Oh, this guy's going to fail this class," or, "What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?" And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, "Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people? Busted." ... Oh, the reason? The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and... I was jealous.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Hospital employee</strong>: Uh, hi, Pam Halpert?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yes?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hospital employee</strong>: Hi. I'm Clark. Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Um, yeah, that would be great.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yup. Really great. When's she available?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Actually, uh, I'm the consultant. Got milk? Ha ha. Alright, let's see what we're working with.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: I'll get that for you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, thank you. Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing. I don't know if she's getting anything.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Okay. Let me feel here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Yeah, it's quite full. Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C. Uh, does that hurt?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, I mean, it feels... pressure.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Are you sure it doesn't hurt?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No. It just feels like pressure.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Okay, well. Feel how I'm flicking the nipple? Like that?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yup.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Stimulate it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Perfect.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: And you can just... The baby should grab on to that.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I think she will.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay. So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though. I'm not sure if...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: We'll figure it out.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: It doesn't... Why don't you bring your baby over here... She's beautiful.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay. Aw, thank you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Yes, congratulations.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Thank you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Clark</strong>: Well, you're doing a good job. Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you. Okay?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Please do.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, sh**t.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: sh**t, she fell off.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: No need. I saw him do it. I can try it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.<br>

  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts. Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?<br>

  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yeah, me too.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: And, you're my friend.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: And I hope that I'm your friend... And, maybe...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, my God, this is agonizing. Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: You said she liked me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin. And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I've dumped better than Erin.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Lynn was as hot as Erin.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: This isn't about me, and that is debatable. And I have a personality, where as you... Yes, Andy?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant] Ow.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Kev... Nice. Going.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Well...<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, hey, Isabelle.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabelle</strong>: Hey. Pam, she's gorgeous. Can I hold her?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yes. She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down. Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her. I don't want her to spit up on you. Come here, sweety... Oh, my God! Wrong baby!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Wrong baby! This is not our baby! Sshh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay, okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, my gosh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kathy</strong>: [waking up] Oh,has she been fussing long?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, not at all.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Perfect.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kathy</strong>: I was out like a light... Oh, she's not hungry...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: How's it going?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Ha ha ha.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Bottles are fine. A lot of babies grow up using bottles. So are you excited to bring your baby home?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: We definitely are. At 3:00, right? You said we could stay until 3:00?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Yeah, you can. It's 2:35.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Half hour.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Twenty five minutes. And you're all set with the car seat?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yes, car seat's right there.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: That bottom part needs to go in the car.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Nurse</strong>: Ha ha, be back in twenty five minutes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be... Can we get a late checkout? I don't... I don't think she heard me.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Isabelle</strong>: [entering the Halpert house] Hello? Dwight? What, what are you doing here?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Isabelle. Hello... Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabelle</strong>: Wow, ha. New cabinets.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yup.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabelle</strong>: All I did was bring macaroni and cheese... Where's the fridge?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh, it's... In the backyard. I'll take this.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabelle</strong>: Oh... Well, I'll let you get back to it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Hey, listen. I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning. You know, just for fun.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabelle</strong>: Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Are they now? Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right? Ha ha.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Isabelle</strong>: Yeah...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Alright. I'll call you, kid.<br>

  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hospital employee</strong>: Mm-hmm... Where's your car?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Uh, it's in the lot.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hospital employee</strong>: Oh, a lot of fathers bring their car around.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Right, okay. Yes, that would be the smart thing to do. Uh, Pam, I will be right back.<br>
  <br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Okay, good.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: It's busy. Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Sorry, that's unacceptable. I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: [tearing up] You can't talk to me like that. I didn't do anything wrong. I've been having a tough day today.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Oh, God, no. I'm... Just read the fax.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: You read the fax.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I'm... I'm asking you out.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Oh, my God. That's amazing. Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: So, it's a date.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Yes. Do you have a day in mind?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yeah, what day? What day?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Everyday is fine. Or...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Well, that, what's that one?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Thursday?<br>
  <br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Hospital employee</strong>: Yeah, we just got a lot of discharges today.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Okay, alright, thanks... Okay, do you want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay... Okay, let me... Just you and me. Come on. There we go... Yeah... Oh, yeah. Like that. There we go. You got it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Five tickets on the windshield... Hey.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hi. We did it.<br>

  <br>

  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Mmm... okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: As you can see, we did pretty well, so...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Right there.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: There's the x-ax...icks.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Mmhmm, okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ho-oh!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: So you have an extra dollar.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I'll be six.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [whistles poorly] Whoo.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you...<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please... [imitates drum roll] Can anybody guess?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: New chairs?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, a new copier! [only Oscar applauds] Unless everybody can agree on something better?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: No, no, please. Please do not do this.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Pam, you make more copies than anyone.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: I'm with Pam. Chairs.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Alright, so, teams forming.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: We should really have the office's air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent k*ll.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You are the silent k*ll. Go back to the annex.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: You'll see.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Michael?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: What? Jim.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Meredith</strong>: Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: The balls on you, man.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: So Michael, what do you think?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Why me?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You have to make the decision.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yeah, do tell.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I mean, like, "156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left."<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Mmhmm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: "Walk until you hear the beehive."<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: How could it be more clear?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I think Andy makes an excellent point.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hey.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Mmhmm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I really think you should reconsider.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah, I know.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: But I really think you should reconsider.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Beesly, are you threatening me?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [shudders] Whew.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Hmm... mm, what's that smell?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You're gonna need to be more specific.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Manure. Get rid of it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You wanna eat, don't you?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Honey, say something!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: ...I'll consider it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. [steps in manure, trying to laugh it off] ...Darn! Heh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: There's a hose out back.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Okay.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Well that never happened.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Michael?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I don't know. I haven't decided yet.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Woah, you guys going to lunch?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Mind if I join?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ohh, God!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: All right.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Let's go.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Let's do it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: All right! Cool!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Where we going?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I have no idea.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. [very serious] It is so on.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: [laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Michael, that is hilarious.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [through the laughter] Oh, is somebody making fun of me?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing]
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Aww.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: That's cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You look really pretty.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Thank you. [goes to Michael's office and knocks on the door]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Michael?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah?<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hey!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, hey.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You got a second?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I do.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, good.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh, that must've been so fun.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: it was fun. We had a good time.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, thank you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah, is that a new tie?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: That is amazing!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Nine dollars. The boys' department.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Look at the ass. Check out the ass.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [applauding] No way!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Look at that. [begins dancing] Unh. Unh-unh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes they were.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: They were.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Here's what I was thinking[/b]: everyone sits on a chair every day...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Mmhmm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: But not everyone...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Sits on a copier.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Or even uses the copier every day.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah, right?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Very valid.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: ...That's it. [giggles]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: All right.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: All right, see you later...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: See ya.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hot tie guy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [laughs] Hahaha!... well...<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: No. I haven't thought of it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I would like cat.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Cats don't make butter.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It doesn't make any sense.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Yes it does!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Okay, guys!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I want a butter sculpture of a cat!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Cow, goat or sheep.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it- [steps in manure] Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, copier's great.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: There they are.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: And I have my original. [holds up original paper, ripped in half]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: You got it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: So suck it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Okay.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, thank you my dear.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: There he is!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: There he is! Hello, hello!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Hello.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Mm! [gives Jim a high five] Yeah!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: There's that ass!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Woo! Yeah. Aw, don't take it away!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh... ah, I almost choked.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Here's another place.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: It's beautiful.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Hey-o!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: [whistling Pachelbel's "Canon in D;" switches to singing then back to whistling]
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [to minister] Hello, I'm Angela Martin, and-<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I'm Andy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I work with Dwight.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: He doesn't understand a word you're saying.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister; minister begins speaking in German] And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, "I do." [Andy mouths, "I do" silently] And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I do.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Hank</strong>: Got a call about a problem up here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Did somebody call Hank?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hank</strong>: So, there's no security problem? You know, I hustled up the stairs.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. [Hank takes some jellybeans from Pam's jar] Yeah, take as many as you want.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hank</strong>: Thank you. Thank you. You know, it's nice and warm up here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hank</strong>: So what are we talking about?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hank</strong>: I know what a surplus is.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hank</strong>: Is that the copier?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: It is, yes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hank</strong>: [inspects the copier] Hmm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hank</strong>: I was just thinking. Let me see a chair.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You can try mine.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, there we go.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hank</strong>: Hmm, not much lumbar support.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hank</strong>: On the one hand, this copier is very old. You should see some of the new copiers they have. You would not believe what they do.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: So, the copier.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hank</strong>: Well, let me finish.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: All right, yes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hank</strong>: Now the chairs. The chairs are very weak. Very weak chairs. I could not sit all day in this chair.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well, what should I do?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Hank</strong>: ...Let me see the copier again.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: All right, get out. Get out.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: What do you mean?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, "I do." And I said, "I do." And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Dwight! That doesn't count!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yes, of course it does.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: No, it doesn't!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It does in the state of Pennsylvania.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I didn't-<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Haha, Mrs. Schrute.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: We are not married.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Wha...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Take this thing. [takes off twine ring]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Are we, uh... are we leaving or what? [Mose hits Andy in the head with a deflated ball] Ow!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">David</strong>: [on speakerphone] Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hey David- [begins coughing violently] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">David</strong>: Is this why you're calling me?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling- [coughs again] I'm sorry.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">David</strong>: Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">David</strong>: You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">David</strong>: Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: The what now?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">David</strong>: Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: ...Like a tip? [calculates amount] $645?!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: [on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: All right, attention everyone.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Let me call you right back. Okay.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is... [puts paper on glass and makes a copy, then takes paper from glass] working perfectly.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: That's the original.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Pam, would you stand up for a sec? [sits in Pam's chair] Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. [slowly sinking into the chair] Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers? [the chair has slowly lowered itself almost to where Michael is not visible over the desk] They don't have copiers. They don't even- [struggles to get up from Pam's chair] Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this: I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Do you know?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Do I know what?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: I think you know.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Mm, no...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Know what?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah, know what?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: $645.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Michael's a genius.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Right.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Why'd you say dollars?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Because that is how my mind works.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wait, what?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You can do that?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5,912?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Let's see...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: You're gonna get us a copier then?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: This is so stupid.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Or chairs?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: This is so, so stupid. And, God... [looks at his watch] that's my phone.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: I didn't hear a phone.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: To be continued!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. [Angela walks over to Andy] What-<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: [kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Was that hot or what?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: So what's it gonna be?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [groans in frustration] You think it's easy?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: It's your job.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just- [Pam and Oscar come to the door of kitchen] Hey.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hey.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Hey, we're going with the chairs.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Thanks Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Good work. I'm proud of you. [Pam and Oscar leave] Mother-<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [wearing a fur coat] What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, [camera zooms out to see fake blood is splattered on the fur coat] you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Truce?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah, I guess, since I won.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam]</div>`,

  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Ohh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [reads memo] I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.<br>

  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: ...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know [Michael leans in closer to Toby] I just wanted to remind it's not appropriate to, to do that.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Woooah! Wow!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Tuna!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Awesome!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: I knew it!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: You guys! Yes! Yes!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Yes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. [gestures to Pam to get up] Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, [to Jim] stand up. [Jim moves over in chair] OK, here we go. [holding both Pam and Jim's hand] Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I love you guys, so much. [hugs Jim]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Phone's ringing. [goes back toward desk]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is [starts to well up] really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I don't see it. I think they both could do better.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Did you plan it?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No. [tries to hide piece of paper, but Pam grabs it]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Blowing up balloons I thought.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You might want to trim it a little.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Michael... [Kelly enters conference room in a flirty red dress]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: [reading sign] Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah, he is.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Oh.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: What do you want?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat].<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Oh, what is that?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Her name was Sprinkles.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You haven't buried her yet?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Don't rush me. I'm grieving.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He k*ll an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away]<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hey Toby.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Hey... [sees both Jim and Pam] you two.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know [makes quotes with fingers] relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, there's no need, really.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official. [Jim smiles]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Uh huh.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Let's just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Let's just wait.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh, OK.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: OK.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Great. [Jim and Pam walk away]<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: [sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back --<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hey!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard. [laughing] He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: OK. Should we get started?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: ...business meeting --<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: [rubbing hands in Ryan's hair] Fire!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Stop that! Stop that!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That's right! That's right!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: [to Kevin] You scared me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Fire guy [makes flames with his hands]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: You weren't here for that.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Here for what?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: When he started the fire.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Little old man boy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Michael and everybody, umm...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Beard.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Bearded man boy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: ...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, wow!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: So...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: OK...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Woooo![laughs] I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Enough! OK? This is inappropriate and it stops right now. Do you understand?
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in [looks at Ryan] 10 minutes?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Perfect.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Sounds good. OK, alright.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, "Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you." His words.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading "Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!"]<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: This is company-wide, Dwight.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Got it. [Andy's hand goes up]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Andy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Can we speak privately about our relationship?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Thank you everybody.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ryan Howard everybody. [starts clapping] Good job. [everyone gets up to leave]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: Cool beans.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: We're screwed.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Who is?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: Us? You and me. The old timers.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No.. [in awe]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: You didn't say anything to me?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Can you believe that...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Oh no, we're just sitting here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: I couldn't see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: OK.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: OK.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: OK.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: OK, what's up?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Well it is business, but not as usual.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: No. [shaking head] We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Good, so, we're on the same page?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: So, how are you?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Good.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: A lot. Black guys mostly.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Kelly...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: What?!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: I don't know.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Did you even try?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: I can't see half of the things. [adjusts glasses]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: It's too little. Use the phone.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: [shaking head]<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: OK. OK.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: We have a date!<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Hello.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Really?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Yes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I would prefer a public place. See you after work.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: Hi, Pam.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Hi.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: Is Michael in?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: In his office. You can go right in.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: [to Ryan] Hey.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Jan.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: So elephant in the room, I have your old job.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Well... you look great.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: Thank you, thank you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Scranton suits you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: Best decision I ever made.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: You were let go.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael's office]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hey.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: Hey.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [holds up Blackberry] Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: So, what's Ryan doing here?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: He's such a snake.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What is that... word?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: So older people have just as many rights as younger people?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jan</strong>: Yes, Michael, they do.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Creed?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: Yes, sir.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: Everything's cool, dude.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: I'm thirty. Well, in November I'll be thirty.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: [notices pictures on the wall] Ohh... man.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Good, we're all here, we can get started.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Have a seat.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: We're not doing this today.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Have a seat. Like everybody else.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: OK. This is...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Still my office, Ryan. [Ryan sits down] Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Toby</strong>: Technically, he's right.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: Because they're lame.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like "where's the Beef?" [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you b*rned your foot.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in]<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert Dunder</strong>: Well, I, I, I haven't been to a board meeting in years. I, I send a proxy.

  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.<br>

  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Great.<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That's great. Thank you for coming in. [starts ushering him out] Robert Dunder everybody. [clapping] Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert Dunder</strong>: Well I, I, I came here in a cab.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Perfect. [starts closing the door]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Robert Dunder</strong>: Well, cou, could you get me another... [Michael closes door]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Inspirational. What have we learned? Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail. [Pam raises hand]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I think that I should help him get home.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam. [Jim nods head and Pam gets up and leaves to help Robert Dunder, Michael shows Robert thumbs up] What a nice guy.<br>

  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Good night guys. [staff leaves the office]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I disagree, I think it was very valuable.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: You know, some place romantic and expensive.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Kelly, come on.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Dry. Delicious.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I heard a joke today.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Oh, that's funny.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: Yes, it was.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Are you enjoying your mineral water?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No, please don't do this, monkey.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Angela</strong>: I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant]<br>

  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Dry rot?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: No!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: You lied about being pregnant.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kelly</strong>: Right, so?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?<br>

  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but...<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I now find you repulsive.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Eh...<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: What's, uh, going on here?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: With gift baskets.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. "You can't be on the team", "You can't move on to second grade". Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. [shakes head] We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: I'm not driving with him. [points at Dwight]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: I'll go with you Stanley.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Stanley</strong>: Or him.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Why don't we just go by ourselves?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: This is stupid.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: What about a gift basket full of cash?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me. [walks toward the door]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Michael, wait. Let me go.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, this is my quest.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. [camera moves around and zooms in at Angela's face] Please.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Good luck Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: We don't need luck.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yeah.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Thank you.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: [speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Creed</strong>: [looks at vending machine] Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Ah, that's a pain in the ass.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I know. So who's next?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">GPS</strong>: Proceed to the highlighted route, then route guidence will begin.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Who?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry]<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. [claps hands] I run into Vince Vaughn.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: No way!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Literally.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: ... Later guys.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Yeah, later dude.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Later man.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Yeah, he's definitely something.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: What does that mean?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: Ha! Tuna... [inhales deeply] Tuna Tuna Tuna.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Tuna Tuna Tuna.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: He has a k*ll job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: And he can get any girl that he wants.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Andy</strong>: So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome... then... you need awesome lessons.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Kevin</strong>: Tuna. Check you later.<br>

  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Larry Myers</strong>: You know we closed our account with you right?<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Mmhmm.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Larry Myers</strong>: OK. I don't think we're coming back.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Please, come back.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Remember what we had Larry?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Larry Myers</strong>: I mean, really it's about money.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Larry Myers</strong>: OK thanks.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Alright.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Larry Myers</strong>: I mean their website is really easy to use too. That's a big deal for us.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [driving] That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That is true.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Like Angela in accounting.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yes, she is nuts.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">GPS</strong>: Make the next right turn.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a sh*t? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Uh totally.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Thank you very much.<br>

  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: You know I have heard it before.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: She's great, thanks for asking. Great memory.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: Oh, OK.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK, OK! So you'll reconsider?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: OK thanks for the goodies.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ah... .is that all you have to say?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: It looks delicious? I don't know.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: You don't know?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Look, we want you back.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: Can you offer lower prices?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Well, no.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: Then we're not coming back.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: He's not coming back, it's over Michael.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No it's not.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: No he's right.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Accept it, why would he come back?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we k*ll it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: Oh, OK. Well when it's up, I'll check it out, and if it really cuts costs maybe we'll come back.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Great, the magic of the gift basket.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: That I don't care about as much. Let me know when the site's up.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">GPS</strong>: Proceed straight.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [in Michael's car] Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: That is a very good point, Dwight.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">GPS</strong>: Make a right turn.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: No, it said right, it said take a right.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right. [turns right]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It can't mean that! There's a lake there!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: The machine knows where it is going!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: This is the lake!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: No, it's--- there's no road here! [car drives into lake]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Remain calm! I have trained for this! [unfastens seat belt] Okay, exit the window! [Dwight and Michael exit through the window] Here we go! Look out for leeches! [swims toward Michael] Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! [Dwight grabs onto Michael while Michael opens the back door for the camera man] Michael! Michael!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Let go, let go of me!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I got you, I got you! [Michael and Dwight reach the ground]<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: [watching car get pulled from lake] You sure you're OK?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Fine.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Good, that is what's most important.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What a disaster, this whole thing.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: I'll call a cab. [brings out cell phone]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. "I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [speaking on the cell phone] Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Hang up. [Dwight hangs up] You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Yes!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Take a stand!<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Thanks.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: I'd love to talk to you about it more.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: That'd be great.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Oh... is it...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Wear something nice.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: No...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: What?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Um...<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: I just... I just wanted to have dinner.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: I'm uh, I'm dating Jim.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: You're kidding?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: We're together.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: That's... great, I... that's awesome.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Yeah, great.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: [grabs paper with mockups] So let me um, let me look at these.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: OK great!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: Cool.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Pam</strong>: Great.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: Did you forget something? What happened to you guys?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: Oh what is this?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: Maybe you should leave.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches! [sits on couch]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna [gets water from his clothes on the couch] Oops, sorry!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Look, my clothes are so wet!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! [rubs shoes on couch]<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: [comes back with gift basket] Alright here you go, take it back!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: It's been opened.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: Yeah it was mine!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: Come on guys, get out of here!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [enters nearby room] Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ex-client</strong>: I ate them OK, I ate the turtles, they're gone!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Dwight</strong>: [leaving] We'll bill you.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: That is not correct.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Oscar</strong>: You did what?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: I drove my car into a [bleep] lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Into a lake.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Exactly!<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Phyllis</strong>: Did you get any clients back?<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives. [looks at Ryan] Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Michael</strong>: Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to m*rder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.<br>
  
  <hr>
  
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did. And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie. ... It was two hundred dollars.<br>

  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: You should come visit. The city is... amazing.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: I know. I love it there.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: No. You don't know until you live there. There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: No. You can't imagine it, though. The energy when you're actually there. You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you. Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Jim</strong>: Sounds great.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="text-strong">Ryan</strong>: No. It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.<br>
